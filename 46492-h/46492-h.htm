<h2>MÉREJKOWSKI</h2>


<p>Dmitri Mérejkowski is perhaps the most
interesting and powerful of the younger Russian
novelists, the only writer that promises to carry on the
work of Tolstoi, Turgeniev, and Dostoievski. His
books, which are already numerous, are animated by a
single master-idea, the Pagano-Christian dualism of
our human nature. What specially interests him in
the vast spectacle of human affairs is the everlasting
contest between the idea of a God-Man and the idea of
a Man-God; that is to say, between the conception of a
God incarnate for awhile (as in Christ) and the conception
of Man as himself God&mdash;gradually evolving higher
types of splendid and ruling character which draw
after them the generations.</p>

<p>The novelist's own doctrine seems to be that both
the Pagan and the Christian elements in our nature,
although distinct elements, are equally legitimate and
sacred. His teaching is that the soul and the senses
have an equal right to be respected; that hedonism
and altruism are equals, and that the really full man,
the perfect man, is he who can ally in harmonious
equilibrium the cult of Dionysus and the cult of Christ.</p>

<p>Mérejkowski conceives that European civilisation
has been born of the tremendous conflict between these
two main ideas. And he has embodied this conflict in
a trilogy of novels,&mdash;three great historical romances.
The first is entitled <i>The Death of the Gods</i>, and deals
with the extraordinary career of the Roman Emperor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IV" id="Page_IV">IV</a></span>
Julian the Apostate, who in the fourth century <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
sought to revive the worship of the Olympians after
Christianity had been adopted by Constantine the
Great as the official religion of the Roman Empire.</p>

<p>The historical novel, pure and simple, exists no
longer. Writers of genius who seem to write historical
novels in reality are only transferring to the stage of
the world a drama which is being played in their own
souls. They transfer thither that drama in order to
show that the struggle which is now going on in us is
eternal. Mérejkowski sees the question, which is of
supreme interest to us, being asked by the great spirits
of a wealthy and imperial civilisation closely resembling
our own, in the fourth century. And, what is of more
interest still, he not only sees the momentous problem
and places it before us with remarkable lucidity, but
he also seems, in his own fashion, to arrive at a solution.
Moreover, this novelist, this psychologist, is also
an artist and a poet, possessed by what he somewhere
calls the "Nostalgia of the Distant." With an ardour
as of Flaubert in <i>Salammbo</i>, and with perhaps more
skill than Sienkiewicz in <i>Quo Vadis</i>, the author of <i>The
Death of the Gods</i> has succeeded in re-creating the
wonderful rich scenes and characters of that remote
epoch. We see the racing stables of the Hippodrome
of Constantinople, battles with wild German warriors
round Strasburg, the interior of the baths at Antioch,
dinners of epicures and men of letters at Athens, pictures
of a Roman Emperor at his toilet-table, or of a
lovelorn child in the Temple of Aphrodite. Before
writing this first of his great romances Mérejkowski
himself travelled through Asia Minor and Greece,
visited Constantinople and Syria, and gathered everywhere
living impressions to serve his art and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_V" id="Page_V">V</a></span>
thought. He was besides admirably prepared to handle
a subject which had attracted him from youth. A delicate
Hellenist, his first appearance in literary life was
as a harmonious translator of Æschylus and Sophocles.
Later, the Gnostics, the Fathers of the Eastern Church,
the Greek Sophists (who represented the last throes of
expiring Paganism and already dreamed of reviving
it), were the young poet's objects of study. Thus was
born the romance of <i>The Death of the Gods</i>, which he
has continued later in <i>The Resurrection of the Gods</i> (of
which Leonardo da Vinci is the hero), and completed
by <i>The Anti-Christ</i>, portraying the savage figure of
Peter the Great, the creator (despite all natural obstacles)
of St. Petersburg and of modern Russia.</p>

<p>In the first romance of the three the new Christian
spirit is seen invading the soul of Julian himself, the last
champion of expiring Paganism. It can even be seen
in the little treatises, <i>The Sun King</i> and the <i>Mother of
the Gods</i>, which Julian wrote in his feverish nights to
defend his lost cause. Soon there remained to this
singular man of all that first ardour but a feeling of impotent
rage and unbridled pride&mdash;the Napoleonic lust
of conquering the world. And so we see him in this
book, in the midst of the mad expedition against
Persia, where he was to meet his death, oversetting
the altar of the gods who had betrayed him, and exclaiming:
"<i>The gods are no more; or rather, the gods
do not yet exist. They are not. But they will be. We
shall all be gods. We have but to dare!</i>" A few days
later he falls, vanquished by the Galilean, whose image
haunts his deathbed. But at that last hour it is not
the fierce God of the Arians (who educated Julian the
Emperor) that he sees. He whom delirium calls up is
Christus Pastophorus,&mdash;the Good Shepherd,&mdash;the Spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">VI</a></span>
of gentleness and love. It is that Spirit who has
dethroned the Olympians.</p>

<p>But the gods do not perish utterly. Centuries pass,
and from the bosom of the waters, like Aphrodite, from
the bosom of the earth, like Cybele, they come forth
again, serene and impassive. Popes, kings, great
nobles, simple Florentine merchants welcome them,
brought by galleys from the coasts of Hellas, or discovered
by patient excavators of the antique soil.
Their marble glory shines anew. The rays of Helios
penetrate the soul of artists. The fires of Dionysus
kindle the blood of the young men and the young
women. It is the dawn of the <i>Renaissance</i>. Has then
the God-Man conquered the Man-God? No; because,
see, Savonarola is defying the gods of Olympus and the
gods of the earth. The latter destroy him, but the
Christ has reappeared, and the problem of the two
forms of wisdom continues to be set in a form more
august and more painful than ever before.</p>

<p>This is the subject of the <i>Renaissance of the Gods</i>, a
romance of which the distinguished critic in the <i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i>, M. Theodore de Wyzewa, says that
it "far surpasses the mass of the romances published
in Russia during the last twenty-five years."</p>

<p>And since then, as before then, as at all times, at
every fresh crisis, at every renewal of the creative process
taking place within human consciousness, the two
principles reappear. They struggle too in the soul of
the strongest. Look at Peter the Great, whom old believers
used to call "The Anti-Christ." He will be
the hero of the third romance of the trilogy. We shall
see therein the tragedy of the gentle Tsarevitch Alexis,
servant of the Galilean and immolated victim of the
new god; victim, that is, of human will incarnate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">VII</a></span>
the genius of Peter, lifting itself above good and evil.</p>

<p>The above notes are largely taken, and partly translated,
from an interesting paper on Mérejkowski by
M. Prozor in the <i>Mercure de France</i>.</p>

<p>About two and a half miles from Cæsarea in Cappadocia,
upon the woody spurs of Mount Argæus,
and close to the great Roman road, bubbled a certain
warm spring, famous for its healing virtues. A granite
slab, adorned with rough sculpture and bearing a Greek
inscription, proved that this spring had of old time
been consecrated to the twin sons of Zeus, Castor and
Pollux; but this by no means prevented the unbroken
images of these Pagan demigods from being locally
worshipped as St. Cosmas and St. Damian respectively.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, opposite the sacred
fountain, rose a little thatched tavern, flanked by a
dirty stable, and by a shed where fowls and geese were
dabbling in the mud. In this tavern, owned by one
Syrax, a wily Armenian, could be bought goats'-milk
cheese, black bread, honey, olive oil, and a thin sour
wine, grown in neighbouring vineyards.</p>

<p>A screen divided the tavern into two compartments;
one for the use of common folk, the other for guests of
more importance. From the smoked ceiling hung
hams curing, and odorous bunches of mountain herbs,
proving that Fortunata, the wife of Syrax, was a careful
housewife; a fact that did not save the dubious
reputation of the establishment.</p>

<p>At night honest travellers dared not halt here, remembering
sundry rumours about dark plots hatched
in the cottage; but Syrax, ever scheming, and knowing
whose hand to cross with silver, had never troubled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
his head about rumour. The partition was formed by
two slender columns, between which was stretched, in
the manner of a door-curtain, an old chlamys (or outer
garment) of faded wool, belonging to the mistress of
the house. The little columns, wrought in a barefaced
attempt at the Doric style, were the pride of the
heart of Syrax and the single ornament of the tavern.
Once gilded, they had long stood creviced and chipped
and hopelessly cracked.</p>

<p>The stuff of the chlamys, when new, had been a
bright violet; now it was a dirty blue, eked out by
many patches, and stained with innumerable stains,
due to the breakfasts, dinners, and suppers of ten years
of the conjugal life of the hard-working Fortunata.</p>

<p>In the clean half of the tavern, on a single narrow
couch, which was torn in many places, Marcus Scuda,
Roman tribune of the ninth cohort of the sixteenth
legion, was lolling before a tankard-strewn table. A
dandy provincial, he had one of those faces at the
sight of which prosperous slaves and second-rate
courtesans would inevitably exclaim with heartfelt
admiration: "<i>What</i> a handsome man!"</p>

<p>At his feet, in an uncomfortable but respectful attitude,
a red-faced man sat, panting. His bald head
was fringed with grey hair, brushed towards the
temples. He was the centurion of the eighth <i>centuria</i>,
Publius Aquila.</p>

<p>Farther off, twelve soldiers, stretched on the floor,
were playing at knuckle-bones.</p>

<p>"By Hercules!" cried Scuda, "I'd rather be the
meanest beggar in Constantinople than the first man in
a mouse-trap like this. Can you call this an existence,
Publius? Answer me honestly. Is this living? To
think that outside barracks and camps the future has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
nothing in store for one; that one must rot in this
sickening marsh without ever catching a glimpse of the
world again!"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Publius; "it's a fact that life here
isn't precisely gay; but on the other hand, it's peaceful!"</p>

<p>The knuckle-bones pre-occupied the attention of the
old captain. Pretending to listen to the gossipings of
his superior officer, and fully to agree with the drift
of his remarks, he followed with an interested eye the
game of the legionaries. He said to himself, "If the
red aims well, he'll certainly win."</p>

<p>However, by way of politeness, Publius asked Scuda,
with a show of attention&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, by the way, have you brought down on
yourself the indignation of the Prefect Helvidius?"</p>

<p>"A woman, a friend of mine, was at the bottom of
it, a girl...."</p>

<p>And Marcus Scuda, in a fit of garrulous intimacy,
confided to the ear of the old centurion that the Prefect,
"that old goat of a Helvidius," had grown jealous
on account of the special favours conferred on him,
Marcus, by a certain frail lady, a Lydian.</p>

<p>Now Scuda wanted, by rendering some important
service, to win back the good-will of the Prefect; and
he had resolved upon a plan.</p>

<p>Not far from Cæsarea, in the fortress of Macellum,
dwelt Julian and Gallus, the cousins of the reigning
Emperor Constantius, and the nephews of Constantine
the Great. These two were the last representatives of
the luckless house of the Flavii. On his accession to the
throne, fearing rivals, Constantius had assassinated
his uncle, the father of Julian and Gallus, Julian Constantius,
the brother of Constantine. But Julian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Gallus themselves had been spared, and imprisoned in
the solitary castle of Macellum, where they lived oppressed
by perpetual fear of death. In great perplexity,
knowing that the new Emperor loathed the two orphans
who reminded him of his crime, Helvidius, Prefect of
Cæsarea, desired, but dreaded, to divine the will of his
master.</p>

<p>Scuda, the adroit tribune, possessed by visions of a
career at Court, grasped, from chance words of his
superior officer, that the latter dared not take upon
himself the heavy responsibility, and trembled lest the
current rumour about an escape of the heirs of Constantine
should be realised in fact. At this point Scuda
made up his mind to go to Macellum, seize the prisoners,
and bring them to Cæsarea under the safeguard
of his legionaries, well assured that he had nothing to
fear from these orphaned minors, abandoned by the
world and hated by the Emperor. By this valiant proceeding,
Scuda counted on regaining the favours of the
Prefect Helvidius, so unhappily lost on account of the
auburn-haired lady of Lydia. Nevertheless, being of a
suspicious nature, he only communicated to Publius
part of his plan.</p>

<p>"And what do you propose now, Scuda? Have
you received instructions from Constantinople?"</p>

<p>"I have received nothing; nobody knows anything;
but there is an everlasting hawking about of rumours,
don't you see? There are endless veiled hopes and
hints, unfinished phrases, threats and warnings, allusions....
Any idiot can do what he has been told
to do. But this is a matter of guessing the mute will
of our master. That's a job that brings reward.
Come, let us make the venture, take the risk. The
great thing is to be speedy and stout-hearted, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
trust in the Holy Cross!... I confide myself to
you, Publius. Perhaps we shall be drinking at Court,
you and I, before many days are over; and, by God, a
better wine than this!"</p>

<p>Through the little barred window filtered the troubled
light of a melancholy dusk. It was raining monotonously.
A single clay wall, full of crevices, separated
the room from the stable. The acrid odour of dung
came though, and the clucking of hens, the shrill
chirping of chickens, and the grunting of pigs was
audible. There came also the steady noise of a liquid
falling into a sonorous can, as if the good wife were
milking her cow. The soldiers, discussing their winnings,
were quarrelling among themselves in undertones.
Close against the floor, through the frail lath
and plaster, a hog had thrust his fat, pink snout.
Caught in too narrow a slit, he could not draw out his
muzzle and was groaning piteously. Publius mused&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jupiter! we're nearer the courtyard of the
cattle than the court of the Emperor!"</p>

<p>His interest in the game had melted away. The
tribune after his excess of confidence himself felt sad.
Through the window he looked at the grey sky, dissolving
itself into water, at the muzzle of the pig, the
thick lees of wine in the tankards, the dirty soldiers.
Anger mounted to his brain.</p>

<p>He struck the table, which swayed on its uneven
legs, with his fist.</p>

<p>"Hi, rascality! betrayer of Christ, Syrax, come
here! What wine do you call that, you scoundrel?"</p>

<p>The innkeeper ran up. He wore hair and beard
frizzled into fine ringlets, black as ebony, with bluish
shadows. Fortunata used to say, in her hours of conjugal
tenderness, that the beard of Syrax was like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
bunch of the grapes of Samos. His eyes were also
black and extraordinarily brilliant, and a honeyed
smile never left his purple lips. He resembled a caricature
of Bacchus, and was black and sugary from
every point of view. To appease the wrath of Scuda,
the innkeeper took to witness Moses and Deidamia,
Christ and Hercules, that his wine was superexcellent.
But the tribune was obstinate, declaring that he knew
in whose house Glabrio, a rich merchant of Lyrnas,
had recently been assassinated; and that he, Scuda,
would denounce Syrax in the proper quarters. Terrified,
the Armenian rushed to the cellars, and brought
back thence in triumph a strange bulky bottle, flat at
its base, narrow-necked, covered with mildew, and grey
with age. Through the mouldiness in places the glass
was visible, no longer transparent, but irised, and
upon the label of cypress-wood attached to the neck of
the bottle could be deciphered the initial letters of
"<i>Anthosmium</i>" and below "<i>Annorum Centum</i>."</p>

<p>But Syrax assured the couple that even in the reign
of the Emperor Diocletian the wine had been more than
a hundred years old.</p>

<p>"Black wine?" asked Publius, with respect.</p>

<p>"Black as tar, and sweet smelling as nectar. Ho! Fortunata!
for this wine bring summer glasses, cups of crystal,
and bring too the whitest snow from the ice-tub."</p>

<p>Fortunata brought in two glasses. Her healthy face
was of a dull pallor like thick cream, and with her came
in the smell of country freshness, milk, and manure.</p>

<p>The landlord gazed at the bottle amorously, and
kissed its neck; then with caution he raised the waxen
seal. The wine flowed black and odorous in a thick
jet, dissolving the snow, while the crystal of the cups
became dull and cloudy under the action of cold.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon Scuda, who had pretensions to learning
(he was capable of confusing Hecuba with Hecate),
declaimed proudly the only line of Martial he could
remember&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Candida nigrescant vetulo crystalla Falerno!</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Wait a moment. Here is something still better,"
and Syrax plunged his hand into his pocket, drew
thence a minute flask carved out of onyx, and with a
sensual smile poured into the wine a drop of precious
Arabian cinnamon. The drop fell, and, like a creaming
pearl, melted into the black liquor. A strangely
heavy perfume filled the room.</p>

<p>While the tribune was slowly drinking, Syrax made
a clacking noise with his tongue, murmuring, "The
wines of Biblos, of Lesbos, of Lathea in Chios, of
Icaria ... are less than nothing to this wine!"</p>

<p>Night was falling. Scuda gave the order to get
ready to march. The legionaries began putting on
their armour, fastened the greave protecting the right
leg, and took up bucklers and lances. When they
entered the outer hall, the Icarian shepherds, who
were brigands rather than shepherds, seated near the
fire, rose respectfully before the Roman tribune. Scuda,
full of a sense of his own rank and valour, felt the
blood burning in his veins and his head buzzing with
the effect of the marvellous liquor.</p>

<p>On the threshold a man approached him. He wore
a strange oriental costume&mdash;a white tunic, striped
with broad red bands, and on his head a high head-dress
of woven camel's hair, and a towering Persian
tiara. Scuda halted. The visage of the Mede was
finely cut, lengthy and meagre, and yellow of hue
rather than olive. The narrow and piercing eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
sparkled maliciously, but all his movements were calm
and majestic. He was one of those wandering magicians
who haughtily declared themselves Chaldeans,
seers, and mathematicians. He announced to the
tribune that his name was Nogodarès. Sojourning by
chance with Syrax, he was travelling from the distant
Hyrcania towards the coasts of the Ionian sea, to meet
the celebrated warlock philosopher, Maximus of Ephesus.
The magician begged for authority to prove his
art and to divine the happy fortune of the tribune.
</p><p>
The shutters were closed. The Mede was preparing
something on the ground; suddenly a slight crackling
was heard; everybody was silent and a flame rose in a
long red tongue amidst wafted flakes of white smoke,
which filled the room. Nogodarès put his pale lips to
a double flute, and played a languid, plaintive air, like
the funeral songs of the Lydians. The flame grew
yellow&mdash;grew fainter, then sparkled anew in pale
flashes. The sorcerer threw into the fire a handful of
dried herbs. They evaporated in a penetrating aroma
which brought on the senses an indefinable melancholy,
like the perfume of half-withered grasses, on some
misty evening, in the arid plains of Arachosia and
Drangiana. Obeying the plaintive call of the flute, a
huge serpent slid out of a black box placed at the
feet of the magician, and slowly, with a sound as of
parchments rubbed together, unwound its glittering
and metallic coils. The wizard chanted in a broken
voice, which seemed to come from afar, and several
times repeated the same syllables, "<i>Mara, mara,
mara!</i>" The serpent coiled itself round his thin body
and caressingly, with a tender hissing, brought its flat
green head and brilliant carbuncled eyes close to the
ear of the enchanter. A whistling, and the forked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
sting flashed, as if the reptile had murmured its secret
to its master, who now threw the flute upon the
ground. The flame filled anew the room with thick
smoke, this time diffusing an odour choking as if exhaled
from the tomb. The flame went out. Darkness
and fear possessed all present; everybody felt it difficult
to breathe. But when the open shutters allowed
the leaden light of the dusk to enter, there remained
no trace of the snake or of the black box. Notwithstanding
this, everybody's face was livid.
</p><p>
Nogodarès approached the tribune&mdash;
</p><p>
"Rejoice! Favour&mdash;great and speedy favour&mdash;awaits
thee from thy great master Augustus Constantius!"
</p><p>
During several moments he scrutinised the hand of
Scuda narrowly. Then, stooping to the level of his
ear, muttered, so as to be heard by none but the
tribune&mdash;
</p><p>
"This hand is dyed with blood&mdash;the blood of a
great prince!"
</p><p>
Scuda grew afraid.
</p><p>
"What dost thou dare to say, cursed hound of a
Chaldean? I am a loyal servant."
</p><p>
But the other probed him with his searching eyes
and half ironically responded&mdash;
</p><p>
"What dost thou fear? Given a few years....
And is glory won without the spilling of blood?"
</p><p>
Pride and joy filled the heart of Scuda when at the
head of his soldiery he quitted the tavern. He drew
near the sacred fountain, crossed himself, and quaffed
that virtuous water, invoking in a fervent prayer St.
Cosmas and St. Damian, that the prediction of Nogodarès
should not fall fruitless. Then he vaulted
upon his haughty Cappadocian charger and gave the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
legionaries the order "March." The standard-bearer
raised the ensign above his bared head. It was the
image of a large dragon, fixed upon a lance, with
gaping jaws of silver and the rest of its body formed of
coloured silk. Unable to withstand the wish to parade
before the crowd assembled at the door of the inn, and
although conscious of peril, intoxicated with wine and
pride, the tribune stretched his sword up the misty
road, and in a loud voice commanded&mdash;
</p><p>
"To Macellum!"
</p><p>
A hum of astonishment ran through the crowd.
The names of Julian and of Gallus were uttered. The
legionary who led the column raised his skyward-twisted
horn, sounded it, and the echoing note of the
Roman trumpet vibrated away amongst the mountains.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">II</h2>

<p>A profound obscurity reigned in the great
sleeping-chamber of Macellum, an ancient palace
of Cappadocian princes.
</p><p>
The bed of the young Julian was very hard,&mdash;a
wooden pallet, laid with a panther-skin. So the young
Julian himself willed it, being bred in the austere
principles of the Stoics by Mardonius, his tutor, a passionate
disciple of ancient philosophy.
</p><p>
Julian was not asleep. The wind, blowing in fierce
gusts, howled like an imprisoned beast between the
chinks of the walls. Then all fell back again into
silence, and in the intent pause large drops of rain
could be heard splashing from the height of the roof
upon the ringing flagstones. The keen ear of Julian
detected at moments the rustling of the rapid flight of a
bat. He distinguished, too, the regular breathing of
his brother, a delicate and girlish lad, who slept upon
a soft bed under mouldy hangings, the last trace of
luxury in this deserted castle. In the next room could
be heard the heavy snore of Mardonius.
</p><p>
Suddenly, the door of the secret staircase in the wall
turned softly upon its hinges. A bright light dazzled
Julian.
</p><p>
Labda, an old slave, entered, carrying in her hand a
metallic lamp.
</p><p>
"Nurse, I'm afraid! Don't take the lamp
away...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
</p><p>
The old woman placed the lamp in a stone niche
above the head of Julian.
</p><p>
"Can you not sleep? You are not in pain? Are
you hungry? That old sinner Mardonius always
keeps you fasting. I've brought you cakes of honey.
They're good.... Taste!"
</p><p>
Making Julian eat was the favourite occupation of
Labda; but she dared not indulge in it by day&mdash;dreading
the severe Mardonius&mdash;and so brought her delicacies
mysteriously under cover of night. Labda, who
was purblind and could scarcely drag her limbs along,
always wore the black religious habit. Although a
devout Christian, she was regarded as being in reality
a Thessalian sorceress. The grimmest superstitions,
old and new, fused in her brain into a strange religion
not far removed from madness. She mingled prayers
with spells, Olympian gods with demons, Christian
rites with the black arts. Her body was behung with
crosses, and amulets carved out of the bones of the
dead; and scapularies, containing the ashes of martyrs,
swung from her shoulders. The old woman felt for
Julian a pious affection, regarding him as the sole and
legitimate successor of Constantine the Great, and
holding Constantius, the reigning Emperor, a murderer
and a usurper.
</p><p>
Labda knew better than anybody the family tree and
traditions of the race of the Flavii. She remembered
the grandfather of Julian, Constantius Chlorus. The
murderous mysteries of the Court lingered on, ineffaceable,
in her memory; and many a time at night would
she tell them to Julian, keeping nothing back, so
that he, at the narrative of events which his childish
brain could not yet comprehend, felt his heart gripped
by fear and indignation. With dull eyes, in a low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
monotonous listless sing-song, Labda, looking like one
of the Fates, would recite these gruesome epic tales of
a few years ago, as if they had been so many legends
of remotest antiquity.
</p><p>
Placing the lamp in a stone niche, Labda blessed
Julian, with a sign of the cross; ascertained that the
amulet of amber was safe on his breast, and, pronouncing
some charms to exorcise ill spirits, vanished.
</p><p>
A heavy half-slumber fell upon Julian. It was
warm; great drops of rain, descending in silence as
into the bottom of a sonorous vessel, lulled him into
languor. He knew not whether he was awake or
asleep; whether it was the breathing of the wind or
Labda which was murmuring at his ear the terrible
secrets of his family. All that he had learnt from her,
and all that he had seen in infancy, fused into a single
fearful dream.
</p><p>
...He sees the dead body of the great Emperor
upon a splendid bier. The corpse is painted; and the
head adorned by the deftest of barbers with an ingenious
dress of false hair. Julian, brought thither to
kiss the hand of his uncle for the last time, is afraid.
The purple, the diadem, with its stones glittering
under the flame of torches, dazzle him. Through the
heavy Arabian perfumes, for the first time in his life
he comes into contact with the odour of a corpse. But
bishops, eunuchs, generals, acclaim the Emperor as if
he were alive; and the ambassadors bow down before
him and return thanks, observing all the punctilious
ceremony of diplomatic etiquette. Scribes read out
the edicts, the laws, the decrees of the senate, and
implore the approval of the dead man; a flattering
murmur surges to and fro among the multitudes;
they declare that he, the Emperor, is so great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
that by a special mercy of Providence he reigns after
death.
</p><p>
The child knows that he whom all glorify has killed
his own son, a brave young man, whose only fault lay
in the people's too great love of him. This son had
been slandered by his stepmother, who loved him with
an unholy love, and had taken her revenge upon him
thus as Phædra upon Hippolytus. Afterwards the wife
of Constantine had been surprised in adulterous intimacy
with a slave of the Imperial stables and had been
stifled in a bath heated to a white heat. And so on,
corpse, upon corpse, victim after victim. Finally, tormented
by conscience, Constantine the Great had implored
priests to shrive his soul from guilt. He was
refused. Thereupon the Bishop Ozius succeeded in
convincing him that one religion only possessed the
power of purifying from sins like his. And therefore
it had come to pass that now the sumptuous <i>Labarum</i>,
the standard bearing wrought in precious stones the
monogram of Christ, glittered above the catafalque of
the parricide.
</p><p>
Julian strove to awake, to open his eyes, and could
not.
</p><p>
Ringing drops fell continually, like heavy tears, and
the wind blew on: but it seemed to him that it was
Labda, the old Fate, babbling near him with her toothless
gums the terrible tales of the Flavii.
</p><p>
Julian dreamed again. He was in the subterranean
vaults of Constantius Chlorus, surrounded by porphyry
sarcophagi containing the ashes of kings. Labda is
hiding him in one of the darkest corners and has
wrapped in her cloak the sickly Gallus, who is shivering
with fever. Suddenly, above their heads in the
palace, groanings resound from room to room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian recognises the voice of his father; struggles
to answer him&mdash;to run to his aid&mdash;but Labda holds
back the child, murmuring, "Quiet! quiet! or they
will be upon us!" and hides him under her chlamys.
Hasty steps clatter upon the staircase&mdash;come nearer
and nearer still; the door bursts into shivers and the
soldiers of Cæsar, disguised as monks, invade the vault.
The Bishop Eusebius of Nicomedia directs the search;
and coats of mail glitter under the black robes of the
searchers.
</p><p>
"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost, answer&mdash;who is there?"
</p><p>
Labda is crouching in a corner, still locking the
children to her breast. Again comes the solemn cry&mdash;
</p><p>
"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of
the Holy Ghost&mdash;who is there?"
</p><p>
The legionaries, sword in hand, explore every hole
and corner; Labda throws herself at their feet; shows
them the sickly Gallus and Julian, defenceless&mdash;
</p><p>
"Fear God! what harm can a six-year-old innocent
like this do to the Emperor?"
</p><p>
And the legionaries force all the kneeling three to
kiss the cross which Eusebius holds out to them, and
to take the oath of faithfulness to the new Emperor.
Julian remembers the great cross of cypress-wood.
There was an enamelled picture of Christ on it. On
the dark base of the wood stains of fresh blood were
still visible, imprinted by the fingers of the cross-bearing
assassin.
</p><p>
Was it the blood of the father of Julian, or of one of
his six cousins, Dalmatius, Hannibal, Nepotian, Constantine
the Younger, or of the others? The murderer,
in order to ascend the throne, had taken six
corpses in his stride, doing each deed in the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the Crucified. And still round the tyrant, day after
day, rose the cloud of victims, a multitude which no
man could number.
</p><p>
Julian awoke full of fears. The rain had ceased and
the wind fallen. The lamp burned steadily in its niche.
Julian sat up on his bed, listening in the silence to the
beatings of his own heart. The hush seemed curiously
insupportable. Suddenly, voices and steps resounded
from room to room, reverberated along the
high arcades of Macellum as formerly along the vaults
of the Flavii. Julian shivered. It seemed to him that
he was dreaming still.
</p><p>
The steps approached; the voices became distinct.
</p><p>
The lad cried out, "Gallus, awake! Mardonius,
don't you hear something?"
</p><p>
Gallus awoke. Barefooted, his grey hair dishevelled,
and clothed in a short sleeping-tunic, Mardonius, his
face bloated, yellow and wrinkled like an old woman's,
rushed towards the secret door.
</p><p>
"The soldiers of the Prefect!... Dress!...
We must fly."
</p><p>
He was too late. The grinding of iron bolts told
that the door was being shut from the outside. The
stone columns of the public staircase flushed with the
light of torches, illumining the purple dragon of a
standard-bearer and the cross upon the breastplates of
legionaries.
</p><p>
"In the name of the most orthodox and blessed
Augustus, Constantius Imperator! I, Marcus Scuda,
Tribune of the Fretensian Legion, take under my safeguard
Julian and Gallus, sons of the Patrician, Julius
Flavius!"
</p><p>
Mardonius, with drawn sword, stood in a warlike
attitude in front of the closed door of the chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
barring the way of the soldiers. This glaive was rusty
and useless, and served the old tutor only to show,
during his lessons in the Iliad, how Hector used to
fight Achilles. At this moment Mardonius, although
he would have been incapable of killing a hen, was
brandishing the sword in the face of Publius, according
to the most correct traditions of Homeric warfare.
Publius, who was drunk, flew into a passion:
</p><p>
"Get out of my way, windbag! Clear out, I tell
you, if you don't want me to slit you!"
</p><p>
He seized Mardonius by the throat and hurled him
against the wall.
</p><p>
Scuda ran to the door of the chamber and opened it.
For the first time in his life he beheld the two last descendants
of Constantius Chlorus. Gallus seemed tall
and strong, but his skin was fine and white as a
young girl's; his eyes, of a wan blue, were indolent
and listless; his flaxen hair, the distinguishing trait
of the house of Constantine, spread in curls over his
powerful neck. But in spite of his masculine appearance,
downy beard, and eighteen years, Gallus at that
moment looked a child. His lips trembled, he blinked
sleep-swollen eyelids, and, crossing himself, continually
whispered: "Lord, have mercy upon me!"
</p><p>
Julian was a thin child, sickly and pale, with irregular
features, thick glossy black hair, too long a nose,
and a too prominent lower lip. But his eyes were
astonishing. Large, strange, and variable, they shone
with a brightness rare in a child's eyes, and an almost
morbid or insane concentration.
</p><p>
Publius, who in his youth had often seen Constantine
the Great, mused&mdash;
</p><p>
"That little rascal will be like his uncle!"
</p><p>
In the presence of the soldiers fear abandoned Julian.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
He was only conscious of anger. With closed teeth,
the panther-skin of his bed flung over his shoulder,
he gazed at Scuda fixedly, his lower lip trembling with
bridled rage. In his right hand, hidden by the fur, he
gripped the handle of a slim Persian dagger given him
by Labda; it was tipped with the keenest of poisons.
</p><p>
"A true wolf's cub!" said one of the legionaries,
pointing out Julian to his companion.
</p><p>
Scuda was about to cross the threshold of the chamber,
when a wild chance of safety flashed upon Mardonius.
Throwing aside his tragic sword, he seized
the mantle of the tribune, and began to scream in a
shrill feminine voice:
</p><p>
"Do you know what you're doing, rascals? How
dare you insult an envoy of Constantius? It is I who
am charged to conduct these two young princes to
Court. The august Emperor has restored them to his
favour. Here is the order from Contantinople!"
</p><p>
"What is he saying?... what order is it?"
</p><p>
Scuda stared at Mardonius. His faded and wrinkled
visage was unmistakably that of a eunuch; and the
tribune knew well what special favour eunuchs enjoyed
at Court.
</p><p>
Mardonius hunted in a drawer, lit on a roll of parchment,
held it out to the tribune, who unrolled it and
immediately grew pale. He only read the first lines,
but saw the name of the Emperor, who referred to
himself in the edict as Our Eternity,&mdash;<i>Nostra æternitas</i>,&mdash;but
remarked neither the date nor the year.
</p><p>
When he perceived, swinging from the parchment,
the great Imperial seal of dark green wax, attached by
golden threads, his eyes clouded; he felt his knees
give way&mdash;
</p><p>
"Pardon, there is some mistake ..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
</p><p>
"Away with you! away with you at once! the
Emperor shall know everything!" retorted Mardonius,
hastily snatching the decree from the trembling
hands of Scuda.
</p><p>
"Don't ruin us! We are all brothers, we're all
sinners! I entreat you in the name of Christ!"
</p><p>
"I know what acts you commit, in the name of
Christ! Go! Go at once."
</p><p>
The tribune gave the order to retire. A single
drunken legionary tried, by fair means or foul, to
hustle Mardonius; but they overbore the rioter by
main force.
</p><p>
When the sound of steps died away, and Mardonius
was assured that all peril was over, he was seized by a
wild fit of laughter which shook the whole of his soft
fleshy person. Forgetting all tutorial dignity, the old
man in his short night tunic began to dance, crying
out gleefully&mdash;
</p><p>
"Children, children! Glory to Hermes! We've
hoodwinked them cleverly! That edict was annulled
three years ago! Ah, the idiots, the idiots!"
</p><p>
At the breaking of dawn, Julian fell into a deep
sleep. He awoke late, refreshed and light-hearted,
when the sun was shining brightly into the room
through the great iron-clamped window.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">III</h2>

<p>Their lesson in doctrinal theology was taught to
the lads in the morning by an Arian priest.
Long and dry as a lath, he had green eyes, damp and
bony hands. This monk, who was named Eutropius,
had the disagreeable habit of gently licking the hollow
of his palm, smoothing his grey hair, and immediately
afterwards making his finger-joints crack. Julian
knew that one movement would inevitably follow the
other, and used to get madly irritated.
</p><p>
Eutropius wore an old black cassock, full of stains
and patches. He used to say that he wore it out of
humility, but, as a matter of fact, he did it from
miserliness.
</p><p>
Such was the instructor chosen by Eusebius of Nicomedia,
the religious guardian of Julian.
</p><p>
This monk suspected in his pupil a certain yeast of
moral perversity, which, unless cured, would draw
upon Julian eternal damnation.
</p><p>
And Eutropius used to talk continually of the grateful
feelings the boy should show towards his benefactor
the Emperor Constantius. Whether he was explaining
the text of the Bible, expounding Arian dogmas, or interpreting
an apostolic parable, all lessons were conducted
to the same conclusion, the "root of holy
obedience and filial docility." And when the Arian
monk spoke of the benefits granted to Julian by the
Emperor, the child would fix upon him his deep
glance; but although each knew the intimate thoughts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
of the other, never did pupil and professor exchange a
word upon the subject. Only if Julian stopped, forgetting
some text, or became confused in the chronological
list of Old Testament patriarchs, or repeated badly the
prayer he had learned by heart, Eutropius would
silently gaze at him, take his ear caressingly between
two fingers, and two long and sharp finger nails would
slowly pierce the flesh.
</p><p>
Eutropius, despite his morose look, was endowed
with a certain ironical gaiety. He gave his pupils the
most affectionate of nicknames, while ridiculing their
imperial origin. When, after pinching Julian's ear,
he saw him grow pale, not with pain but with rage, he
would whisper in humility&mdash;
</p><p>
"Your Majesty does not deign to feel anger against
Eutropius, his humble and unlearned slave?" and,
licking the palm of his hand, he would smooth the grey
locks of his temples, crack his long fingers, and add
that it was wholesome sometimes to give naughty,
idle little boys a whipping; that form of instruction
being often mentioned in Holy Writ as the most effective
means of enlightening the souls of the dark and
disobedient. He used only to say it to tame the diabolic
pride of Julian, who, moreover, was well aware
that Eutropius would never dare to put his threat into
execution. The monk himself was convinced that the
child would rather die than undergo such a humiliation.
But the tutor, nevertheless, loved to discourse
upon the topic often and long.
</p><p>
At the end of the lesson, during the explanation of
a text, Julian once mentioned the earth's antipodes,
about which he had heard Mardonius speaking. He
had done this with the secret intention of annoying
the monk, but Eutropius became jocular.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
</p><p>
"Who's been talking to you about 'antipodes,' my
angel? Little sinner, how you do make me laugh!
That old fool of a Plato did, I know, write something
about it. But are you actually wise enough to believe
that men walk about on their heads?"
</p><p>
Eutropius would launch forth into accusations of
heresy against the philosophers. Was it not a scandal
to imagine that mankind&mdash;created after the image of
God&mdash;could walk about upside down, and so bring
Heaven into contempt? And when Julian, insulted by
insults to his favourite philosophers, argued that the
earth was shaped like a globe, Eutropius became
serious and lost his temper, purple with fury and
stamping his feet&mdash;
</p><p>
"It's that heathen, Mardonius, who teaches you
these godless lies!"
</p><p>
When he got angry he would splutter and shower
the hearer with his spittle, which Julian believed must
be venomous. Exasperated, the monk would savagely
attack all the Greek sages. Wounded to the quick by
the suggestions of Julian, forgetting that his pupil was
a mere child, he burst into serious harangues, accusing
Pythagoras of being mad, impudent, audacious, affirming
that the atrocious "Utopias" of Plato were not fit
to read, and that the instruction of Socrates was clean
against reason.
</p><p>
"Read what Diogenes Lærtius says of Socrates!
You will see that not only was he a money-lender, but
that he practised vices which no decent man can name."
</p><p>
Epicurus, above all, excited the whole of his rancour;
the beastliness with which he plunged into pleasures
of all kinds, the brutality with which he used to satisfy
his sensual desires, were proof enough that he was less
than human.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
</p><p>
Resuming something of his habitual calm, Eutropius
on this particular day betook himself to explaining
some hair-splitting scholastic distinction of the Arian
dogma, and waxed wroth with the same heat against
the orthodox &oelig;cumenical Church, which he considered
heretical.
</p><p>
From the splendid and desolate garden a warm
breeze came in through the open window. Julian
feigned to listen to Eutropius. Really he was dreaming
of a very different person, his well-loved teacher
Mardonius. He recollected his wise lectures; his readings
of Homer and Hesiod&mdash;how different from these
monkish lessons!
</p><p>
Mardonius did not <i>read</i> Homer; following the custom
of the ancient rhapsodists, he used to chant the poems,
to the great amusement of Labda, who was wont to
say that he bayed like a dog at the moon. And in fact
he did appear absurd to folk who heard him for the
first time. The eunuch would punctiliously scan each
foot of the hexameter, beating time with his hand.
And while his yellow and wrinkled visage remained
intensely rapt, his shrill feminine voice streamed on
from strophe to strophe. Julian never remarked the
ugliness of the old man, seeing only the throbbing passion
of a soul thrilled by grandeur and beauty.
</p><p>
His listener trembled, while the divine hexameters
rose and shouted like waves. He saw the farewells of
Andromache and Hector; the wanderings of Ulysses,
weeping for Ithaca on the melancholy and sterile beach
of Calypso's island. Delicious sorrow seized the heart
of Julian; pains of yearning for Hellas, the country of
the gods, eternally beautiful, land of all beauty-worshippers.
Tears shook in the voice of the teacher,
and rolled down his withered cheeks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
</p><p>
Sometimes Mardonius would talk with the boy of
goodness, of the austerity of virtue, of the death
of heroes for freedom's sake. Little indeed, oh!
how little, did these lessons resemble those given by
Eutropius.
</p><p>
Mardonius used also to narrate the life of Socrates;
and when he came to the "Apology," delivered by the
philosopher before his death to the people of Athens,
the old master would rise, and triumphantly declaim
the speech from memory, a calm irony lighting his face.
These were less the phrases of a man accused, than the
ringing tones of a judge addressing the people.
</p><p>
"Socrates does not ask for pardon. All the power,
all the laws of a government are absolutely nothing beside
the liberty of the soul of man. Yes! the Athenians
can kill a man without taking from him the freedom
and the happiness of his immortal soul." And when
this barbarian, this ex-slave from the banks of the
Borysthenes, pronounced the word "liberty" it seemed
to Julian that the word contained such superhuman
power that beside it even the Homeric pictures lost
lustre. Fixing on his master his great wide, haunting
eyes, the lad shook with enthusiasm.
</p><p>
The cold touch of a hand at his ear drew Julian from
his dreams. The lesson of the catechist was finished.
On his knees he recited the prayer of thanksgiving;
then escaping from Eutropius he ran to his room, took
down a book, and hastened to a solitary nook in the
garden to read at ease the <i>Symposium</i> of Plato, the
pagan, a book forbidden above all others. On the stairs
Julian met the monk, who was departing&mdash;
</p><p>
"Wait, my dear boy! What book is your Majesty
carrying?"
</p><p>
Julian stared at him and tranquilly tendered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
volume. On the parchment binding Eutropius read
the title, written in great capitals, "The Epistles of St.
Paul the Apostle," and gave back the book unopened.
</p><p>
"That's all right! Remember that I have to answer
for your soul to God and to the sublime Emperor.
Don't read heretical books, especially none of those
frivolous philosophers whom I have to-day condemned."
</p><p>
It was the habitual trick of the boy to wrap dangerous
books in innocent bindings. Julian from his infancy
had learnt dissimulation, and even took pleasure in deceiving
others, especially Eutropius. He dissembled
and lied needlessly and habitually, prompted by deep-seated
anger and revenge. To Mardonius alone his
behaviour was always open and gracious.
</p><p>
Intrigues, scandals, gossipings, suspicions continually
arose at Macellum among the numberless idle
servants. The whole pack of varletry, in the hope of
Court favour, subjected the two disgraced young princes
to espionage by night and day. Long as Julian could
remember, death was an hourly expectation. Little
by little he had accustomed himself to perpetual fear,
being quite aware that neither in the house nor garden
could he take a step or make a gesture unperceived by
a thousand intent but invisible eyes. Hearing and
understanding much of the toils about him, the boy
was forced to feign ignorance. At one time it was
the conversation between Eutropius and a spy sent by
the Emperor Constantius, in which the monk named
Julian and Gallus "the imperial scourges"; at another
time, in the gallery under the kitchen windows, it was
the meditation of a cook, furious at some insolence on
the part of Gallus. She was saying to the washer-up
of the dishes, "God save my soul, Priscilla, but what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
I can't make out is, why they haven't strangled them
before!"
</p><p>
To-day, when Julian, after his lesson in theology,
went out of the house and perceived the greenness of
the trees, he breathed more freely. The two peaks of
Mount Argæus, covered with snow, sparkled against
blue sky. The neighbourhood of glaciers made the air
refreshingly cool; garden alleys stretched hither and
thither into the distance; glistening dark-green foliage
of oaks formed thick vaultings; here and there a ray
filtered through the branches of plane-trees. Only one
side of the garden was not walled in, for in that direction
lay a chasm. At the foot of the plateau on which
the castle stood, a dead plain stretched as far as Anti-Taurus,
and from this plain fierce heat rose in mist,
while in the garden fresh streams were running and
little waterfalls tinkling through thickets of oleanders.
</p><p>
A century before the date of which we are speaking
Macellum had been the favourite domain and pleasure-house
of the luxurious and half-mad Ariarathes, king
of Cappadocia.
</p><p>
Julian took his way towards an isolated grotto, hard
by the precipice, in which a statue of the god Pan,
playing the flute, stood over a little sacrificial altar.
Outside the grotto, a lion's mouth jetted water into a
stone basin, and a curtain of roses masked the entrance
while letting through its branches a view of the undulating
hills and the plain, far down and drowned in
misty blue. The perfume of roses filled the little cave,
and the air there would have been oppressive had it not
been cooled by a stream channelled in the rocky floor.
</p><p>
The wind scattered the turf with yellow petals of
roses, and flung them floating on the water of the
basin. From the dark and warm place of shelter could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
be heard the humming of bees. There Julian, stretched
on the moss, used to read the <i>Banquet</i> of Plato, understanding
nothing of many of the passages; but their
beauty had for him a double relish because it was a
fruit forbidden.
</p><p>
When his reading was done, Julian wrapped the book
anew in the binding of the "Epistles of the Apostle
Paul," went up to the altar of Pan, gazed at the joyous
god as at an old accomplice, and, thrusting his hand
into a heap of dried leaves, drew from the interior of
the altar, which was cracked and covered with a piece
of board, a small object carefully enveloped in cloth. It
was his own handiwork&mdash;a delightful little Liburnian
trireme, or galley with three banks of oars. He set it
swimming in the basin; the galley rocked on the miniature
waves. The model was complete,&mdash;three masts,
rigging, oars, gilded prow, and sails made of a fragment
of purple silk, the gift of Labda. Nothing was wanting
but to fix the rudder, and the boy began the task.
</p><p>
From time to time, while planing a piece of board,
he would look into the distance, at the hills outlined
in mist through the hedge of roses. Beside his plaything
Julian soon forgot all vexations, all hates, and
the eternal fear of death. In this little cave he imagined
himself a shipwrecked sailor. He was the wily Ulysses
in some solitary cavern facing the ocean, building a
ship in which he might win back again to Ithaca. But
down yonder, there among the hills, where the houses
of Cæsarea shone white as the sea-foam, a little cross,
glittering high above the roof of the basilica, irritated
him still. That everlasting cross! Could he never be
free of it, even here in his own cave? He would resolve
not to see it, and stooping, redoubled his attention
to the galley.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
</p><p>
"Julian!" a voice cried; "Julian, Julian! Where in
the world is he? Eutropius is looking for you to go to
church with him."
</p><p>
The boy shivered, and nimbly hid his handiwork
inside the altar of Pan. He smoothed his hair, shook
his clothes, and when he came out of the grotto had
resumed an expression of impenetrable Christian
hypocrisy.
</p><p>
Eutropius, holding Julian's hand in his bony one,
conducted him to church.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">IV</h2>

<p>The Arian basilica of St. Maurice was built almost
entirely of blocks taken from the ruined temple
of Apollo. The sacred court, the <i>atrium</i>, was surrounded
by colonnades. In the middle of this court
murmured a fountain, placed there for the ablutions of
the faithful. Under one of the side porticoes lay an
ancient oaken tomb darkened with age; and in this
tomb were the wonder-working bones of St. Mamas,
for which Eutropius had obliged Julian and Gallus
themselves to build a stone-work shrine. The task of
Gallus, who took to it as to a game, went rapidly forward,
while the wall of Julian frequently crumbled and
proved oddly unsatisfactory; a phenomenon which
Eutropius explained by remarking that St. Mamas refused
the offering of children possessed by the demon
of pride.
</p><p>
The halt, the maimed, the sick, and the blind, expectant
of miracle, thronged near the tomb. Julian
understood why they stationed themselves here. One
of the monks used to hold a pair of balances; the pilgrims&mdash;some
of them come from hamlets many leagues
away&mdash;weighed with scrupulous care pieces of linen,
woollen stuff, or silk; and having laid them on the
tomb of St. Mamas, would fall to praying all night.
At daylight the stuff was weighed over again, and the
weight compared with the weight on the previous day.
If the texture proved heavier, it was declared that the
prayer had been answered, that the divine mercy, like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
dew, had soaked into the stuff and rendered it capable
of producing all manner of marvellous cures.
</p><p>
But frequently the prayer was in vain. The stuff
weighed just what it did before; and pilgrims would
pass whole days, weeks, even months, waiting at the
sepulchre. Among the latter there was an old woman
named Theodula. Some called her demented; others
counted her a saint. For years she had not quitted the
tomb of St. Mamas. The daughter for whose restoration
she had come to pray had now been a long while
dead. But Theodula continued kneeling ceaselessly
before her faded and ravelled fragment of cloth.
</p><p>
From the outer court three doors led into the basilica&mdash;one
for women, one for men, and the third, in the
centre, for monks and the lower clergy. With Eutropius
and Gallus, Julian went in through this last door,
being <i>anagnost</i> or reader of the lessons for the day.
Clothed in a long black robe with white sleeves, his
hair anointed, and bound back by a fillet that it might
not fall into his eyes while reading aloud, Julian passed
through the midst of the faithful, his eyes fixed humbly
on the ground. His pale face assumed almost involuntarily
the inevitable and hypocritical expression of submissiveness.
He ascended the high rood-loft. The
frescoes of the wall to the right depicted the martyrdom
of St. Euthymus, in which one executioner seized the
sufferer's head, while another, wrenching open his
mouth with pincers, brought the cup of molten lead to
his lips. In another scene the executioner with an instrument
of torture was flaying the childish and bleeding
limbs of St. Euthymus, hanging from a tree by his
hands. Beneath these frescoes ran the inscription,
"With the blood of the martyrs, O Lord, Thy church
is arrayed as in purple and fine linen."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
</p><p>
On the opposite wall sinners were burning in the
fire of the pit, and above them rose Paradise and the
saints. One of the saints was plucking the fruits of
the tree of Eden; another playing the psaltery; and a
third, couched on a cloud, contemplated with a beatific
smile the tortures of the damned. Beneath were written
the words, "Behold! there shall be tears and
gnashing of teeth!" The adorers of St. Mamas entered
the church like a procession of all human maladies.
The bandy-legged, the blind, the armless, the
anæmic, children tottering along like old men, epileptics,
idiots with pale faces and inflamed eyelids&mdash;all bore
the mark of a dull and desperate submission. When
the choir ceased, there could be heard the contrite
sighings of the "widows of the church," black-robed
nuns of the order of St. Basil, and the jingling of the
chains of old Pamphilus, who for many a long year had
addressed no word to the living, muttering only,
"Lord, Lord, give me tears!&mdash;grant me mercy!&mdash;give
me an end to remembrance!"
</p><p>
The atmosphere was that of a warm sepulchral chamber,
thick, loaded with incense and the smell of melting
wax, hot oil, and the breath of all these sick persons.
Now it was Julian's lot on that day to read aloud part
of the Apocalypse.
</p><p>
The terrifying pictures of the Revelation were unfolded,
the white horse of Death soared through space
above the peoples of the earth, as they knelt weeping
at the nearness of the world's end.
</p><p>
"<i>The sun becomes dark as pitch, and the moon red as
blood. Men say to the mountains, Fall on us and hide us
from the throne of God and from the wrath of the Lamb,
for the great day of His anger is come, and who can resist
it?</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
</p><p>
Over and over again came the prophecy: "<i>Men shall
seek death and shall not find it; they shall desire death
and it shall flee from them.</i>"
</p><p>
Lamentation arose: "<i>Thrice happy are the dead!</i>"
and "<i>Then came the bloody destruction of all peoples, and
the angel cast his sickle into the earth and gathered the
vintage of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press
of the wrath of God, and the wine-press was trodden without
the city; and there came out blood from the wine-press
even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand
and six hundred furlongs</i>," and men cursed the God
of heaven for their plagues, and they did not repent
them of their sins; and the angel sang: "<i>He Who
worships the Beast and his image shall drink of the wine
of the wrath of God, prepared in the cup of His anger,
and shall be tormented in fire and sulphur before the holy
angels and the Lamb, and the smoke of his torture shall
rise in the night of ages. For he who shall adore the
Beast and his image shall rest no more.</i>"
</p><p>
Julian ended. A profound hush succeeded in the
church. Painful sighs rose from the terrified crowd;
and the noise of foreheads struck against the earth and
the clank of the fetters of Pamphilus, accompanying his
perpetual murmur: "Lord, Lord, give me tears!&mdash;grant
me mercy!&mdash;give me an end of remembrance!"
</p><p>
The child raised his eyes towards the spandril of
mosaic between the columns of the arcade, representing
the Arian image of Christ; a sombre, terrible figure,
its wasted face aureoled in gold, and diademed in the
fashion of the Byzantine emperors. It was the face of
an old man, with a long thin nose and lips severely
shut. With his right hand he was blessing the world;
in the left he held a book in which was written,
"Peace be with you; I am the Light of the World."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
He was seated on a splendid throne, and a Roman emperor
(Julian imagined that it must be Constantius)
was in the act of kissing his feet.
</p><p>
In the penumbral shadow below this image, lighted
by a single lamp, could be discerned a bas-relief on a
sarcophagus, dating from the earliest Christian times.
It displayed sea-nymphs, leopards, gay tritons blowing
their horns, and among them Moses, Jonah and his
whale, Orpheus charming the beasts with his lyre, an
olive-branch, and a dove; the whole sculpture a symbol
of pure and childlike faith. In the midst stood the
Good Shepherd bearing on his shoulder the sheep that
had gone astray, the soul of the sinner. This barefooted
youthful figure, with beardless face, had the
joyous and simple bearing of a poor peasant, and his
smile something of a heavenly sweetness.
</p><p>
Julian imagined that nobody nowadays knew or saw
that Good Shepherd; and this little picture of old times
was somehow connected in his mind with a dream of
his childhood which he tried in vain to recover.
</p><p>
And, gazing at this youth, who seemed as if mysteriously
reproaching him, he murmured the name
picked up from Mardonius, "Galilean!" At that
moment slanting rays of the sun through the windows
trembled, above, in a cloud of incense, which, aflame
with reflections from the gilded aureole, seemed to upheave
the sombre and terrible image of the Arian
Christ. The choir chanted, "<i>Let all human flesh be
dumb and bow down, fearful and trembling, thinking no
more of the things of the earth; for the Emperor of emperors,
the Lord of lords, has given Himself afresh as a
pledge and a food to His faithful; even He who is surrounded
by the hosts of angels, by all powers and dominions,
by cherubim with innumerable eyes, and by the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
<i>six-winged seraphim, veiling their faces and singing,
'Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!'</i>"
</p><p>
Like a tempest the psalm swept over the bowed
heads of the pilgrims. The figure of the Good Shepherd
faded into the distance; but its youthful gaze
remained steadily fixed upon Julian, a gaze full of
reproach. The heart of the child was moved, not by a
sense of worship, but by an intolerable fear; a fear before
that mystery which was for him to remain for ever
insoluble.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">V</h2>

<p>From the Arian basilica Julian returned to Macellum,
and got out his little galley which he had
prepared for this special occasion; and learning that
Eutropius, after the Mass, had gone a journey of
several days, the boy slipped through the barred gates
of the fortress, and ran to the temple of Aphrodite,
close to the church of St. Maurice. The sacred wood
of the goddess bordered the Christian cemetery. Endless
hostilities, debates, wranglings, and even lawsuits,
were kept up between these two temples. The Christians
begged for the destruction of the Pagan shrine;
Olympiodorus, the sacrificing priest, on the other hand,
complained that the custodians of the basilica by night
would secretly cut down ancient cypresses in the sacred
wood, and dig graves for Christians in the soil belonging
to Aphrodite.
</p><p>
Into the wood Julian wound his way; a warm breeze
blew softly on his cheek. In the afternoon heat the
grey and fibrous bark of the cypresses trickled with
thick resinous tears. To Julian the dusk seemed perfumed
by the very breath of the goddess.
</p><p>
The white bodies of statues stood up in sharp relief
against the rich shadow of trees. An Eros there had
been maimed by some custodian of the basilica, who
had rudely smashed off its marble bow. The weapon
of the little winged Love-god, together with his hands,
lay in deep grass at the foot of the pedestal. But although
one-armed, the mischievous boy continued to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
take aim, and a mad smile of malice still fluttered on
his lips.
</p><p>
Julian entered the house of the priest, Olympiodorus.
Its rooms were small but comfortable, and rather bare
than luxurious. There was neither carpet nor silver
dish to be seen; the floors and furniture were of wood,
and the vessels of clay. But everything bore the stamp
of taste. The handle of the kitchen lamp was a marvellous
little work of art representing Neptune with
his trident; the bold outlines of earthen jars, full of
olive oil, won the admiration of Julian; and along the
walls ran light frescoes, water nymphs mounted on sea-unicorns;
and dancing women, clothed in the long robe
of votaries of Pallas Athene, hovered along in graceful
scroll-work.
</p><p>
The little house stood all smiling in its bath of sunshine.
Nereids, dancers, sea-unicorns, the Neptune
on the lamp, and the inmates of the house, all seemed
folk cheerful by nature, guiltless of ugliness, of malice
or spleen. A couple of dozen olives, some white bread,
a bunch of grapes, some wine and water, these were
enough to turn the little meal into a feast, and Diophane,
the wife of Olympiodorus, had in fact tied a
wreath of laurel to the door to mark that very day a
feast-day.
</p><p>
Julian went into the little garden of the atrium.
Under the blue sky a jet of water pulsed into the air,
and in the midst of narcissus, acanthus-blossom, tulips,
and myrrh, rose a bronze Hermes, winged and smiling
like the rest of the cottage, and poised in the act of
taking flight. Above the flowers, butterflies and bees
playing in the sunshine chased each other, and in the
shade of the porch Olympiodorus and his daughter
Amaryllis, a pretty girl of some seventeen springs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
were playing the Greek game of <i>kottabos</i>. On a slender
column fixed in the earth, and oscillating like the scale
of a balance, lay a little beam, which bore, slung from
each end, a cup; under each cup stood an amphora full
of water, crowned by a statuette in metal. The game
consisted in throwing from a certain distance a few
drops of wine, in as high a curve as possible, into one
of the little cups, which, thus suddenly weighted,
would descend and strike the statuette.
</p><p>
"Play, play; it is your turn!" cried Amaryllis.
</p><p>
"One, two, three!" Olympiodorus threw the contents
of his goblet, and missed.
</p><p>
He burst out into a boyish laugh. It was strange to
see the tall grey-headed man so wholly absorbed in
his game.
</p><p>
The young girl, with a charming movement of her
bare arm, threw back her mauve tunic and in her turn
flung the liquid. The little cup of the <i>kottabos</i> rang
upon the statuette. Amaryllis began laughing and
clapping her hands. Suddenly, on the threshold they
saw Julian, and both rushed to welcome him. Amaryllis
cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"Diophane! where art thou? Come and see what
guest we've got to-day. Quick, quick!"
</p><p>
Diophane ran from the kitchen.
</p><p>
"Julian, my darling child!... Don't you
think he is grown thinner? How long it is since we
have seen you!..."
</p><p>
And she added, radiant with good humour&mdash;
</p><p>
"You may well be merry, children, for this evening
we shall have a real feast. I'm going to prepare
crowns of fresh roses; I shall fry three perch, and
make you cakes of gingerbread!"
</p><p>
At this moment a young slave accosted Olympiodorus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
and whispered in his ear that a rich patrician lady of
Cæsarea wished to see him, having something to discuss
with the priest of Aphrodite.
</p><p>
Olympiodorus followed the slave. Julian and Amaryllis
went on with the game of <i>kottabos</i>. Presently a
little twelve-year-old girl came shyly up to them. It
was Psyche, the pale fair-haired and youngest child
of Olympiodorus. She had great sad blue eyes, and,
alone in the house, seemed a stranger to the cult of
Aphrodite, and apart from the general gaiety. Keeping
aloof from the rest, she would remain musing while
others were laughing, and nobody knew what made
her sad, or what gave her pleasure. Her father
pitied her as one incurably sick, ruined by the evil
eye or by the witchcrafts of his eternal enemies the
Galileans, who had carried off the soul of his child in
revenge.
</p><p>
The dark Amaryllis was the favourite daughter of
Olympiodorus: but the mother secretly spoiled Psyche,
and loved with jealous passion the delicate child whose
inner life was hidden from her. Psyche, unknown to
her father, and in despite of the caresses, prayers, and
even the threats of her mother, used to attend the
basilican church of St. Maurice. Anguished on discovering
this, the priest of Venus had renounced
Psyche; and when her name was mentioned, his brow
would cloud over with a bitter expression. He was
sure that it was by reason of the impiety of his child
that the vine, once blessed by Aphrodite, produced
fewer fruits than of yore; he believed that the little
golden crucifix worn on the child's neck had profaned
the temple of the indignant goddess.
</p><p>
"Why do you go to that church?" Julian asked her
one day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
</p><p>
"I don't know; it is comfortable there. Have you
seen the Good Shepherd?"
</p><p>
"Yes, the Galilean! How did you know about
Him?"
</p><p>
"Old Theodula told me. Ever since then I have
gone to church; and, tell me, Julian, why do they all
hate the Good Shepherd?"
</p><p>
At this moment Olympiodorus returned in triumph
and narrated his interview with the patrician lady, a
young girl whom her betrothed had abandoned. She
believed him bewitched by the amulets of a rival.
Many a time had she gone to the Christian church and
besought St. Mamas with an aching heart, but neither
fasts nor prostrations had snapped the evil charm.
</p><p>
"As if the Christians could console her!" Olympiodorus
contemptuously concluded, throwing a keen
glance at the attentive Psyche. "This Christian girl
has now sought my help, and Aphrodite will heal
her!"
</p><p>
He produced the two white pigeons, bound together,
which the Christian had begged him to offer as a sacrifice
to the goddess of love. Amaryllis took the little
creatures in her hand, and kissed their rosy beaks, declaring
that it would be a thousand pities to kill them.
</p><p>
"Father, we will offer them to the goddess without
spilling a drop of blood!"
</p><p>
"How? There can be no sacrifice without bloodshed."
</p><p>
"We will give them liberty. They shall fly away
clean into heaven, straight to the footstool of Aphrodite.
Is she not in the sky? She will accept them.
Let me do this, darling father, I beg of you!"
</p><p>
Olympiodorus had not the heart to deny this entreaty;
and the young girl, unbinding the pigeons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
tossed them back to liberty. They fled away into the
sky with a delirious beating of white wings, making for
the footstool of Aphrodite. Shading his eyes with his
hands the priest watched the offering of the convert
disappear into the clouds, while Amaryllis danced with
joy, crying&mdash;
</p><p>
"Aphrodite, Aphrodite, receive the gift!"
</p><p>
Olympiodorus went out. Julian, solemn-faced and
timorous, approached Amaryllis; his cheeks grew red,
and his voice trembled as he pronounced the name of
the young girl.
</p><p>
"Amaryllis, I have brought you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Ah! I have long been going to ask you what it
could be."
</p><p>
"It is a galley with three banks of oars!"
</p><p>
"A galley! What do you mean?"
</p><p>
"A real Liburnian galley."
</p><p>
He immediately began to unroll his present, but suddenly
aware that Amaryllis was watching him, he felt
ineffable shame, became confused, and with an imploring
look at the damsel, slid the ship into the basin of
the fountain.
</p><p>
"You see, Amaryllis ... it is a trireme ...
a real trireme, with&mdash;with&mdash;sails ... and ...
its rudder.... Look how well it gets under way!"
</p><p>
But Amaryllis laughed heartily.
</p><p>
"What an odd boy you are! What in the world
should I do with your trireme? I fear it wouldn't
take me very far. It's a ship for mice and flies.
Make a present of it to Psyche; she will be delighted
with it."
</p><p>
Julian, though deeply hurt, assumed indifference,
while tears choked his speech. Controlling himself,
he said disdainfully, but with trembling lips&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
</p><p>
"I see that you don't understand anything ... about
art."
</p><p>
Amaryllis laughed yet more heartily. To add insult
to injury, a summons came for her to receive her betrothed,
a rich merchant from Samos, who dressed
badly, perfumed his person, and spoke vile grammar.
Julian hated him, and when he learnt of the arrival of
the Samian, the charm of the house vanished so far as
he was concerned.
</p><p>
From the neighbouring room he could hear the distracting
chatter of Amaryllis and the voice of her lover.
</p><p>
Without uttering a word, and filled with cold hatred,
Julian seized his cherished trireme&mdash;the real Liburnian
trireme which had cost him such endless pains&mdash;and
before the startled eyes of Psyche, snapped the mast,
tore down the sails, tangled the rigging, and stamped
the toy into atoms with his feet.
</p><p>
Amaryllis returned. Her face bore traces of a
strange happiness, of that superfluity of life and love-joy
which awakens in young girls an imperious need
to embrace and to kiss those near them.
</p><p>
"Julian ... forgive me ... I have pained
you. Forgive me, dear! you know well that I love
you."
</p><p>
And before he had time to make up his mind, Amaryllis,
throwing back her tunic, imprisoned his head in
her fresh bare arms. A delightful dread stopped the
beating of Julian's heart; he saw her great dark dewy
eyes so close to him, the sweet odour of her body so
overwhelmed him, and she locked him so close against
her breast, that the boy grew giddy. He closed his
eyes and felt a kiss long, too long, pressed upon his lips.
</p><p>
The voice of the Samian broke the enchantment&mdash;
</p><p>
"Amaryllis, Amaryllis! where art thou?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian putting forth all his strength pushed the girl
away, his heart overflowed with pain and hatred, and
crying, "Let me go, let me go!" snatched himself free
and fled.
</p><p>
Deaf and heedless he escaped from the house through
the vineyards and the cypress wood; nor halted till he
reached the temple of Aphrodite. Now and again he
heard his name called, and the gay voice of Diophane,
announcing that the cakes of gingerbread were ready;
but he made no reply. Search was made for him. He
lay in hiding in the thicket of laurels at the feet of
Eros. Accustomed to his fits of moroseness, they
gave up the search, satisfied that he had returned to
Macellum.
</p><p>
When all around was restored again to silence, Julian
came out from his hiding-place and gazed at the
temple of the goddess of love, lodged upon a gentle
hill, and bare to view on all sides. The Ionic marble
columns, flooded with sunshine, were softly steeped in
the warmth of azure, receiving its ardent embraces
with the cold purity of snow.
</p><p>
Each corner of the façade was surmounted by pedestalled
griffins, with lifted talons, beaks gaping, and
woman-shaped breasts, standing out, proud and austere,
against the deep blue of the sky.
</p><p>
Julian went up the steps into the portico, pushed
open the bronze doors and penetrated the interior of the
temple up to the very shrine, the <i>naos</i>.
</p><p>
Silence and coolness surrounded him. The setting
sun overhead still fell on the capitals of the columns,
and their fine illumined scroll-work, contrasted with
the penumbral shadow on the floor of the temple,
seemed soft and bright as tresses of gold. A tripod,
still burning, diffused the odour of myrrh.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian, leaning against the wall, lifted his eyes in
fear, restraining his breath till it almost died upon his
lips.
</p><p>
She, the goddess herself, was before him. Under
the open sky, in the midst of the temple, stood, cold
and white, new-born of the sea-foam, Aphrodite Anadyomene.
With a smile she contemplated the heavens
and the sea, wondering at their charm; as if unwitting
still that their beauty was her own beauty, glassed in
the eternal mirrors of the azure and the waters. No
raiment profaned her divine body. Naked and chaste
she rose, as the clear sky soaring above her.
</p><p>
Julian gazed on with an insatiate gaze, and felt quick
thrills of adoration sweep over his frame. The child,
in his black monkish habit, knelt before Aphrodite, his
face upturned, his hands pressed to his palpitating
little heart.
</p><p>
Then still aloof, still timorous, he sat at the foot of
the column. He leant his cheek against the marble.
Peace sank slowly into his soul. He fell asleep.
</p><p>
But, even through that slumber, he was conscious
of her presence.
</p><p>
She came down towards him, nearer, nearer....
Her delicate white hands stole round his neck. The
boy with a smile submitted to these passionless endearments;
the cold of the marble chilled his very heart.
That divine embrace bore no likeness to the wild clasp
of Amaryllis. The soul of Julian, freeing itself from
earthly love, entered depths of repose, as into some
ambrosial night of Homer, or the sweet rest of the
dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Julian awoke it was night. Over the roofless
quadrilateral stars were shining, and the crescent moon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
shedding her silver upon the head of the statue.
Julian arose. Olympiodorus must have meanwhile
been tending the temple, although he had either not
observed or had refrained from waking the child; for
now, on the bronze tripod, fresh charcoal was glowing,
and a fillet of odorous smoke arising towards the goddess.
</p><p>
Julian smiling approached, and from the chrysolite
cup, between the feet of the tripod, took a few grains
of incense and flung them on the coals. Smoke rose
more thickly, and the ruddy glow of the fire, like a pale
flush of life, came over the face of the statue, contending
with the soft new-born shine of the moon.
</p><p>
Julian bowed down and kissed the marble feet, and
watered them with his tears, exclaiming&mdash;
</p><p>
"Aphrodite! Aphrodite! thou shalt be my everlasting
love!"

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VI</h2>

<p>In one of the foul and dirty quarters of the Syrian
Seleucia, the port for Antioch on the shores of the
Inner Sea, narrow and tortuous alleys debouched into a
market-place lying along the quays. The sea-horizon
was invisible, so thick was the throng of masts and the
tangle of rigging. The houses were a mass of miserable
little shells, whitewashed within and encumbered
with furniture. Their fronts were garnished with
tattered carpets, dirty fragments of cloth, and ravelled
matting. In every nook and hovel and crowded court,
along kennels and gutters of dirty fever-stricken water
from laundries and baths of the poor, there lay seething
in its penury and hunger a populace strangely cosmopolitan.
</p><p>
The sun, after thoroughly baking the earth, had just
descended below the horizon; wide-winged twilight was
settling slowly down; a stifling heat of dust and fog
still weighed on the spirits of the city. From the market
square breathed a suffocating atmosphere of flesh and
vegetables, becoming rotten through lying all day in
the blaze of the sun. Half-naked slaves were carrying
bales of merchandise from the ships. Their heads
were close-shaven; through their rags could be seen horrible
blotches on the skin; and the greater number bore
on their faces, in brandings by red-hot iron, the Latin
letters C. F., that is to say <i>Cave Furem</i> ('ware thief!).
</p><p>
Braziers were being slowly lighted. But notwithstanding
the approach of night, traffic and discussion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
gave no sign of ceasing in the network of alleys.
From a neighbouring forge piercing blows of the hammer
resounded on bars of iron, and flames shot up the
sooty draught-hole. Hard by, slaves of a bakery,
naked, covered from head to foot in flour-dust, and
with eyelids inflamed by heat, were putting loaves into
an oven. A shoemaker sat in his open-air stall, amid
an insupportable smell of cobbler's glue and leather,
stitching shoes by the light of a smoky lamp. He
was squatting on his heels, and chanting desert songs
at the top of his voice. Two old hags like witches,
with hair streaming in the wind, were slowly passing
across the little square in front of a row of hovels.
They were yelling at each other, wrangling and
threatening each other with fists and stones. The
subject of dispute was the ownership of a cord on
which to dry linen. A huckster, from a distant village,
was hurrying along to be in time for the morning
market. He was mounted on an old mare, flanked
with wicker paniers, each heaped with rotting fish;
the fetid smell of his load made passers-by edge off to
a distance. A loutish urchin, with red hair and skin,
was solacing his soul by beating on a great pan, while
other children, a sickly multitude coming into the
world and leaving it by hundreds daily, marched
amidst this scene of poverty, grunting like pigs, round
the pools of the quay. The water was full of orange-peel
and egg-shells. In yet more villainous passages,
inhabited by thieves, the smell of sour wine came from
wine-shops, and sailors from every beach of the world
marched along arm in arm, shouting drunken songs.
</p><p>
Surrounding all that noise, that filth and spilth of
human misery, there murmured, sighed, and grumbled,
the infinite, distant, and invisible sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
</p><p>
Directly over against the subterranean kitchen windows
of a Ph&oelig;nician dealer, ragged gamblers were
playing at knuckle-bones, and gossiping. From the
kitchen warm gusts of boiling gravy, game, and spices
ascended, greedily snuffed-up, with closed eyes, by the
hungry gamesters.
</p><p>
A certain Christian, a dyer of purple, dismissed for
theft from a rich factory at Tyre, was murmuring, as
he hungrily sucked a mallow-leaf thrown away by the
cook,&mdash;
</p><p>
"And at Antioch, my friends, what's going on
there makes one shiver at nights, just to think of
it. Why, a few days ago the hungry folk tore in pieces
the Prefect Theophilus&mdash;and for what reason? Nobody
knows! When the thing was done they remembered
too late that the poor wretch was a good sort
of fellow and a respectable man. I suggested that perhaps
the Emperor had pointed him out for punishment."
</p><p>
A consumptive old man, a very skilful cardsharper,
replied&mdash;
</p><p>
"I have seen the Cæsar, and I like him. Quite
young, fair as flax, with a good-natured, fat face.
But, as you say, what crimes are committed nowadays!
what crimes indeed! Why one can't put one's nose
outside the door without danger."
</p><p>
"Ah, that's nothing to do with Cæsar! it's his
wife, Constantia, the old witch, that does it!"
</p><p>
But strange personages came near the knot of talkers
and thrust themselves forward, as if desiring to take
part in the conversation.
</p><p>
If the kitchen firelight had been brighter, it would
have been noticed that their faces were begrimed and
their clothes fouled and torn like those of stage-beggars;
and notwithstanding their raggedness the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
hands of these persons were fine and white, and their
nails pared and crimsoned. One of them whispered in
his comrade's ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"Listen, Agamemnon; here also they're talking
about Cæsar."
</p><p>
He whom they called Agamemnon appeared to be
drunk. He wore a beard, which was too thick and
long to be natural, and gave him the aspect of a fantastic
brigand. His eyes were debonair, almost boyish,
and of a bright blue. His friends frequently pulled
him back, muttering&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now then be careful!"
</p><p>
The consumptive old man went on in a whining
tone&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now tell me plainly, my friends, is it just? The
price of bread is going up every day. People dying
like flies. And, suddenly, guess what happens? Lately
a great ship came from Egypt; everybody's happy,
thinking that it brings bread. The word goes round
that Cæsar has made the ship come to feed the people.
And what do you think it was, my friends? Powder,
Alexandrian powder, if you please! a special pink
Libyan powder to rub down the wrestlers!&mdash;powder for
the Emperor's gladiators&mdash;powder instead of bread!...
Eh?... Now is that justice?"
</p><p>
Agamemnon nudged his companion's elbow.
</p><p>
"Ask his name, quick&mdash;ask!"
</p><p>
"Gently, wait a bit...."
</p><p>
A leather dresser remarked&mdash;
</p><p>
"Here in Seleucia the town is quiet, but up at
Antioch there are nothing but traitors, spies, and informers."
</p><p>
The dyer, licking the mallow-leaf for the last time,
growled and mumbled&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
</p><p>
"Yes, unless God comes down to help us, soon flesh
and blood will be going a deal cheaper than bread and
wine!"
</p><p>
The currier, a philosophic tippler, sighed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah! ah! ah! we're all poor creatures! The gods
of Olympus play at ball with us! Men weep and the
gods laugh!"
</p><p>
The companion of Agamemnon meanwhile had succeeded
in joining the conversation, and with nonchalant
adroitness acertained the names of the talkers. He had
intercepted the news, conveyed by the cobbler to the
leather-dresser, about a plot hatched against Cæsar's
life by the soldiers of the Pretorian guard. Then,
strolling on a few paces, he had written down the names
of the talkers with a jewelled stilus on tablets of soft
wax, where many other names were inscribed already.
At this moment hoarse sounds like the roarings of some
subterranean monster came from the market square.
They were the notes, now plaintive, now lively, of a
hydraulic organ.
</p><p>
At the entrance to a showman's travelling booth, a
blind slave, for four obols a day, was pumping up the
water which produced this extraordinary harmony.
</p><p>
Agamemnon dragged his companion towards the
booth, a great tent with blue awnings sprinkled with
silver tinsel. A lantern lighted the black-board on
which the order of the programme was chalked up, in
Syriac and Greek. An oppressive atmosphere of garlic
and lamp-oil prevailed inside, where, beside the organ,
there struck up the wailing of two harsh flutes, while
a negro, rolling the whites of his eyes, thrummed on
an Arab drum. A dancer was skipping to and fro on a
tight-rope, keeping time to the music with his hands,
and singing the latest street song:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Huc, huc, convenite nunc...</p>
<p>Spatolocinædi!</p>
<p>Pedem tendite</p>
<p>Cursum addite...</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This starveling mountebank was old, impudent, and
repulsively cheery. Drops of sweat, mixed with paint,
were trickling from his shaven face. His wrinkles,
plastered with white lead, looked like the cracks in a
wall when rain has washed off the lime. When he
withdrew, the flutes and the organ ceased, and on the
platform a fifteen-year-old girl appeared. She was to
perform the <i>Cordax</i>, a celebrated licentious dance
adored by the mob. Fathers of the Church might
anathematise, and Roman laws interdict this dance,
but both did so in vain. Everywhere the Cordax was
danced as before by rich and poor, by street-dancers as
well as by wives of senators.
</p><p>
Agamemnon murmured with enthusiasm:
</p><p>
"What a divinely pretty girl!"
</p><p>
Thanks to jostling by his companions he had reached
a place in the front rank of spectators. The slender
bronze body of the Nubian was only veiled round the
hips by a light and transparent rose-coloured scarf.
Her hair was wound on the top of her head in close
fine curls, like those of Ethiopian women. Her face
was of the severest Egyptian type, recalling that of the
Sphinx.
</p><p>
She began to dance in careless fashion, as if already
out-wearied. Above her head she swung heavy steel
bells, castanets or "crotals,"&mdash;swung them lazily and
loosely. But the movements became more emphatic,
and suddenly under long lashes yellow eyes shone out,
clear and bright as the eyes of a leopardess. She
straightened her body. The steel crotals shook with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
such a challenge in their piercing sound that the crowd
shivered and became still. The damsel whirled rapidly,
vivid, slender, supple as a serpent; her nostrils dilated,
a strange cry came crooning from her throat, and at
each sharp movement her brown bosom shook and
trembled within its almost invisible meshes of fine
green silk.
</p><p>
The crowd howled with enthusiasm. Agamemnon
struggled with rage because his companions held him
back. Suddenly the girl stopped. A slight shudder
ran through her body. Deep silence prevailed. The
head of the Nubian was thrown back as if in a rigid
swoon, but above it the crotals still shivered with an
extraordinary languor, a dying vibration, quick and
tender as the wing-flutterings of a captive butterfly.
The flashing of the yellow eyes died away, although
the eyeball kept its sparkling lights, and the face remained
severe; but upon the dark and sensuous lips
of that sphinx-like mouth a smile trembled, faint as the
dying sound of the crotals.
</p><p>
The public shouted and applauded so loudly that the
blue tent with its stars and spangles swayed like a sail
in a hurricane. The showman became apprehensive
lest his booth should collapse. The companions of
Agamemnon at last failed to hold him back; raising
the curtain, he rushed through the scenes into the part
reserved for the dancers and actors. In vain his
friends counselled&mdash;
</p><p>
"Wait; to-morrow you shall have everything as you
wish! now something might...."
</p><p>
Agamemnon interrupted them&mdash;
</p><p>
"Not to-morrow; now, at once!"
</p><p>
He approached the owner of the show, the cunning
and grey-bearded Greek, Mirmes, and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
explanation flung into the skirt of his robe a handful
of gold pieces.
</p><p>
"Is that dancing-girl your slave?"
</p><p>
"Yes. What does your excellency desire?"
</p><p>
Mirmes, evidently astonished, was staring now at
Agamemnon and now at the gold.
</p><p>
"What's your name, girl?"
</p><p>
"Phyllis."
</p><p>
He bestowed money on her also, without stopping to
reckon it.
</p><p>
The Greek murmured some words in the ear of the
smiling Phyllis, who tossed up the pieces and threw
sparkling glances at Agamemnon. He said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Come with me!"
</p><p>
Phyllis threw over her shoulders a dark cloak
and glided with him into the street, asking submissively&mdash;
</p><p>
"Whither?"
</p><p>
"I don't know."
</p><p>
"To your house?"
</p><p>
"Impossible. I live at Antioch."
</p><p>
"And as for me, I only arrived in this city this
morning. What, then, are we to do?"
</p><p>
"Wait a moment; I saw just now in a lane near
this the temple of Priapus open. Let us go there!"
</p><p>
Phyllis led him on hastily, laughing. The companions
of Agamemnon desired to follow him, but he
said to them&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is unnecessary&mdash;remain here."
</p><p>
"Be careful! At any rate take a weapon, the quarter
is dangerous..." and drawing from under his
dress a dagger with a jewelled hilt, one of the friends
of Agamemnon respectfully tendered it to him.
</p><p>
Groping at every step into thick darkness, Agamemnon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and Phyllis made their way up a narrow passage
out of the market-place.
</p><p>
"Here! here it is! Fear nothing&mdash;go in!"
</p><p>
They found themselves in the vestibule of a little
vacant temple, its ancient and massive columns ill-lighted
by the flicker of a lamp.
</p><p>
"Push-to the door!" and Phyllis, softly laughing,
threw her warm cloak upon the ground. When Agamemnon
took her into his arms, it seemed to him that
round his body had coiled some warm lithe snake,
with wide and terrifying eyes. At that moment from
the interior of the temple came harsh cacklings, and
such a gust of beating wings went past that the lamp
nearly went out. Agamemnon disengaged his arms
from Phyllis' waist and stammered&mdash;
</p><p>
"What in the world was that?"
</p><p>
In the dense darkness white forms were slipping by
them like so many ghosts. Thoroughly frightened,
Agamemnon crossed himself.
</p><p>
"What is it? May the Holy Cross protect us!"
</p><p>
Something stoutly nipped his leg. He yelled with
pain and fear, but seizing one of his unknown enemies
by the throat, he poignarded another. Deafening cries
arose, followed by squeals and repeated battlings of
wings. The lamp flickered for the last time, and
Phyllis cried, laughing&mdash;
</p><p>
"They are the ganders! the holy ganders of Priapus!
What a crime you have committed!"
</p><p>
Pale and trembling, the conqueror stood holding in
one hand the bloody dagger and in the other two slain
ganders. A crowd carrying torches burst with shouts
into the temple, led by Scabra, the old priestess of
Priapus. This dame had been peacefully supping in a
neighbouring tavern when the trumpeting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
ganders had raised the alarm. Gathering a train of
nocturnal prowlers she had rushed to the rescue.
Hook-nosed, with unkempt grey hair, and eyes blazing
like two steel points, the old priestess looked nothing
less than a fury. She shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Help! help! The temples are desecrated, and
the holy ganders of Priapus slain! And see here, here
are the foul Christians!"
</p><p>
Phyllis fled, enveloping her face in the cloak, while
the crowd dragged off Agamemnon, so cleanly taken
aback that he never thought of relaxing his grip upon
the ganders.
</p><p>
Scabra sent for the clerks of the market, the agoranomes.
But with every moment the crowd grew larger,
and Agamemnon's companions ran to support him. It
was too late. From dens, wine-shops, alley stalls, a
world of loiterers rushed up, attracted by the noise.
All faces wore the expression of gleeful curiosity peculiar
to idlers. The blacksmith appeared with hammer
over his shoulder; the two old women had forgotten
their quarrel; the floury baker jostled the lame cobbler,
and behind them came the genial red-headed boy,
shouting, and beating on his pan, as if calling to
arms.
</p><p>
Meantime Scabra continued screaming, her nails
fixed in the clothes of Agamemnon&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah, just wait! wait a minute! let me get at that
cursed beard of yours! I wont leave a hair in it!
Out, carrion! food for crows! And you aren't worth
the rope you will cost, thief!"
</p><p>
Finally the sleepy guardians of the market appeared;
persons of curious demeanour, themselves liker common
rogues than keepers of the peace.
</p><p>
Such a deafening din of laughs, oaths, and screams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
now ensued that nobody was audible. One shouted,
"He's an assassin!" another, "A thief!" a third,
"Let's burn him!"
</p><p>
Suddenly above the hubbub rang out the masterful
voice of a tawny half-naked giant, the attendant in a
public bath, an individual with a demagogue's gift for
oratory:
</p><p>
"Citizens, listen to me, and mark what I say! I've
long been watching this rascal and his companions!
They are writing down our names! They are Cæsar's
spies!"
</p><p>
Scabra, at last putting her threat into execution,
seized Agamemnon's beard in one hand and his tresses
in the other. He strove to repulse her, but she pulled
with might and main, and to the general surprise black
hair and beard both remained in the hands of the old
woman, who stumbled and fell. Instead of Agamemnon,
an athletic young man with fair curling hair and
short beard stood before the people.
</p><p>
In its astonishment, the crowd was momentarily
silenced; but the voice of the bath-slave was soon
heard clamouring anew:
</p><p>
"See, citizens, they are disguised informers!"
</p><p>
Somebody cried out&mdash;
</p><p>
"Strike him! Knock him down!"
</p><p>
The crowd became tumultuous. Stones were thrown;
the sham beggars of Agamemnon's company encircled
him with drawn swords. At the first stroke the luckless
leather-dresser was killed, and fell in a pool of
blood. The red-headed boy was trampled under foot,
and all faces were becoming ferocious, when at this
juncture ten enormous Paphlagonian slaves bearing
on their shoulders a purple litter impatiently thrust
their way through the crowd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
</p><p>
"Saved!" cried the fair-haired young man, and
vaulted into the litter with one of his fellows.
</p><p>
The Paphlagonians hoisted the pair on their
shoulders and set off at sharp run. The infuriated
crowd were making as if to dash in pursuit, with intent
to stone them, when somebody called out&mdash;
</p><p>
"Citizens, don't you see that it is Cæsar himself&mdash;Gallus
Cæsar!"
</p><p>
The mob halted, paralysed by fear, and the purple
litter, swaying on the shoulders of the slaves like a
skiff in a heavy sea, vanished into the darkness up the
street.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Six years had elapsed since the incarceration of
Julian and of Gallus in the Cappadocian fortress of
Macellum. Constantius had restored them to favour.
Julian, then twenty years old, was sent to Constantinople,
and given leave to travel in Asia Minor. Gallus,
the Emperor had named to be his co-regent, with
the title of Cæsar. Nevertheless this unlooked-for
favour was no valid earnest of good-will. Constantius
loved to destroy his enemies after having lulled
away mistrust by a display of exuberant affection.
</p><p>
"Well, Glycon, Constantia may beg me as much as
she likes, in future, to go out in false hair! But it's
all over for me! I've done with it!"
</p><p>
"We warned your Majesty that it was dangerous."
</p><p>
But Cæsar, stretched on the soft cushions of the litter,
had already forgotten his alarm, and cried, laughing&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glycon! Glycon! <i>did</i> you see the old woman rolling
on the ground with my beard?"
</p><p>
When they arrived at the palace Cæsar ordered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Quick! Let me have a perfumed bath and supper.
The walk has famished me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
</p><p>
A courier came near holding a letter.
</p><p>
"What is it, Norban? No, no, we will have business
to-morrow morning."
</p><p>
"Let the magnanimity of Cæsar pardon me! It is
an important message sent direct from the camp of the
Emperor Constantius."
</p><p>
"From Constantius? Give it me."
</p><p>
Gallus broke the seal of the missive, read, and grew
pale. His knees gave way&mdash;he would have almost
fallen without the support of his courtiers.
</p><p>
Constantius, in exquisite and flattering terms, invited
his tenderly-loved cousin to come to Milan. At
the same time the Emperor summoned the two legions
lodged at Antioch, the only bodyguard left to Gallus.
Constantius designed thus to leave him defenceless and
draw his rival into the snare. When Gallus had recovered
presence of mind he murmured weakly&mdash;
</p><p>
"Call my wife!"
</p><p>
"Your Majesty's Imperial consort has just set out
for Antioch."
</p><p>
"What! She knows nothing of this?"
</p><p>
"No."
</p><p>
"My God, my God! What is to be done? What
can be done without her? Tell the envoy of the Emperor&mdash;No,
say nothing to him&mdash;I scarcely know&mdash;How
is it possible to arrive at a decision alone? Send a
swift post to Constantia.... Say that Cæsar
begs her to return! My God, what is to be done?"
</p><p>
He paced up and down distractedly, now hiding his
face in his hands, now nervously twisting his fair beard
and repeating, "No, no, nothing in the world will induce
me to go. I would rather die! Ah! I know
Constantius!"
</p><p>
Another messenger came up, a scroll in his hand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
</p><p>
"From the spouse of Cæsar! Her Highness in
leaving begged you to sign this as soon as possible."
</p><p>
"What! Another sentence of death?...
Clement of Alexandria ... this is really too
much. Three a day...."
</p><p>
"Cæsar, it was your consort's desire."
</p><p>
"Well, well, what matters it? Nothing! Where's
the pen? Nothing matters now! But why has she
gone away? How can I get out of this pretty pass
single-handed?"
</p><p>
And having signed the death-warrant he fixed those
charming and listless blue eyes upon the servants.
</p><p>
"The bath is ready, sire, and the supper will be
served after it."
</p><p>
"The supper? I'm hungry no longer. But what
dish is there?"
</p><p>
"Truffles from Africa."
</p><p>
"Fresh gathered?"
</p><p>
"They arrived this morning."
</p><p>
"Would n't it be better to raise an army, eh?
What do you say, my friends? I feel so overwhelmed....
Truffles, you say? I was thinking about
truffles only this afternoon."
</p><p>
The agitation of his countenance gave way to the
airiest of smiles. Before plunging into the water,
which was made milky and iridescent by the infusion
of perfumes, Gallus waved his hand lightly:
</p><p>
"Pooh! the great thing is not to think! God have
mercy on us all!... Perhaps after all Constantia
will smooth over the matter...."
</p><p>
And his chubby face suddenly lighted while he plunged
with glee into the scented water. He called out gaily&mdash;
</p><p>
"Tell the head cook to add a dressing of red pepper
to the truffles!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VII</h2>

<p>At Nicomedia, at Pergamos, and at Smyrna Julian,
now nineteen years old and an enthusiast for
Hellenic wisdom, had heard much of the famous mage
and sophist, Iamblicus of Chaldea, a pupil of the Neo-Platonist,
Porphyrius. Men used commonly to call
him "the Divine" Iamblicus. In order to see this
master, Julian made a journey to Ephesus.
</p><p>
Iamblicus was a little thin and wrinkled old man.
He liked complaining of his ailments&mdash;gout, rheumatism,
nervous headache; he abused physicians, but was
zealous in carrying out their advice, and used to speak
with deep interest of drugs and infusions of herbs. He
always wore, even in summer, a double tunic; never
seemed warm enough, and would sit basking in the
sun like a lizard.
</p><p>
From his youth up Iamblicus had broken himself of
the habit of meat-eating, and spoke of it with disgust
as a practice beyond his comprehension. His servant
used to prepare for him a special broth, made of barley-water,
warm wine, and honey, he being toothless and
unable to masticate bread.
</p><p>
He was always surrounded by numberless admiring
students who had travelled from Rome, Antioch,
Carthagena; from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Persia, to
become his pupils.
</p><p>
All stoutly believed Iamblicus could work miracles.
Iamblicus treated them like a father irritated at seeing
round him so many weaklings. When they began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
discuss and to wrangle, the master would make a
sweeping gesture, followed by a grimace expressive of
physical pain. He spoke gently, and in a low-toned,
agreeable voice; the louder other folk shouted the
more subdued his own tone became. He hated all
noise, and quarrelsome voices as much as creaking
sandals.
</p><p>
Julian gazed in disappointed perplexity at this chilly,
sickly, and whimsical old man. What power drew towards
him the world of philosophy? He remembered
the story of pupils&mdash;that one night the divine master
during prayer was upraised by some invisible force
to a height of twelve cubits from earth, wrapped in a
golden glory. Another tale was about a miracle, by
which the master had smitten from a rock two warm
springs, Eros and Anteros, the two Dæmons of love&mdash;the
one dull-souled, the other joyous. Iamblicus, it
was said, had caressed both, like children, and at a
word caused them to disappear.
</p><p>
But in listening to the master Julian never succeeded
in discovering the potency of his words. The meta-physic
of the school of Porphyrius seemed to him dull,
dead, and painfully complicated. Iamblicus would, it
is true, emerge a playful victor from the most difficult
dialectical discussions. His teaching about God, about
the World, about the Ideas, was full of profound learning;
but in it lay no vital stimulus. Julian had hoped
otherwise, and nevertheless he hung about, and did
not set off again homewards. The eyes of Iamblicus
were strange, green, and deeply-sunk in his bronzed
face. Julian was persuaded that these weird and by
no means holy eyes betokened some hidden wisdom,
the occult wisdom of the serpent, concerning which
Iamblicus never spoke to his pupils. But when "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Divine," in his cracked voice, used to ask why his
barley broth was not ready, or complained of gout, the
spell was broken.
</p><p>
On one occasion Iamblicus was sauntering with
Julian on the seashore, outside the town. It was a
soft and melancholy evening. Behind the castle of
Panormos in the distance glittered, with their array
of statues, the terraces of the celebrated temple of the
Ephesian Artemis.
</p><p>
The dark reeds along the sandy shore made no rustle.
It was the spot where Latona gave birth to Artemis and
Apollo. Smoke of numberless altars in the sacred
Orthegian wood was rising in columns into the sky.
To the south the Samian mountains shone blue on the
horizon. Wavelets fell calmly as the breathings of a
child, and pellucid waves swelled over the rocks. The
setting sun, hidden behind vapour, gilded the edge of
enormous cloud-masses.
</p><p>
Iamblicus seated himself upon a boulder, and Julian
threw himself on the ground at his feet. The master
caressed the thick black locks of the pupil.
</p><p>
"Are you sad?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"I know you are sad. You seek and you do not
find. You have not the strength to say '<i>He is</i>,' and
you are afraid to say '<i>He is not</i>.'"
</p><p>
"How have you guessed this, Master?"
</p><p>
"My poor boy! for fifty years have I not suffered
from the same pain? And I shall suffer from it till I
die. Do you imagine that I know Him better than you&mdash;that
I have discovered what you have missed? <i>That</i>
is the birth-pain that never ceases. Beside it other
tortures are as nothing. People think that they suffer
from hunger, from poverty, from thirst; in reality they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
suffer only from the thought that perhaps He has no
existence. Who shall dare to say '<i>He exists not</i>?'
and yet what superhuman strength one must have to
say, '<i>He is</i>'!"
</p><p>
"Do you mean to say that you, even you, have
never come near Him?"
</p><p>
"Thrice in my life have I borne the ecstacy of feeling
myself wholly at one with Him. Plotinus felt it
four times, Porphyrius five times. But as for me, the
moments in my existence in which life was worth
living were precisely three."
</p><p>
"I have questioned your pupils on this subject; they
knew nothing."
</p><p>
"Have they the courage to know? The shell of
wisdom is enough for them; the kernel, for almost
everybody, is deadly."
</p><p>
"Well, let me die, Master! Give the core to me!"
</p><p>
"Have you courage?"
</p><p>
"Yes; but speak&mdash;speak!"
</p><p>
"And what can I tell you? I do not know, ...
and need I tell you? Listen to the calmness of the
evening, and the secret will be yours without words of
mine...."
</p><p>
He kept stroking Julian's head; the boy was dreaming,
"This, this is what I waited for," and clasping
the knees of Iamblicus he falteringly entreated&mdash;
</p><p>
"Master, have pity!... Reveal it all!...
Do not desert me!"
</p><p>
With green and strangely motionless eyes kept
steadily on the clouds, Iamblicus murmured, as if
speaking to himself:
</p><p>
"Yes, we have all forgotten the voice of God. Like
children estranged from the cradle from the face of
their father, we hear Him, and we do not recognise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Him. To hear His voice, every earthly cry in our
souls must cease. Just so long as reason shines and
illumines our souls, we remain imprisoned in ourselves
and see not God. But when reason is put by, ecstacy
falls upon us like the dew of night&mdash;that ecstacy which
the evil cannot know. The wise, the good alone can
become, of their own will, lyres vibrating under the
hand of God. Whence comes that beam which falls
into the soul? I do not know. It comes unawares,
and when one least expects it. To search for it is useless.
God is not remote from us. One must make
ready, with a soul becalmed; and simply wait, as the
eyes await (according to the saying of the poet) <i>the
rush of the sun from dark ocean</i>. God does not come,
God does not go away; He is revealed. He is, what
the universe is not, the negation of everything that
exists. He is nothing, and He is All."
</p><p>
Iamblicus rose and slowly extended his wasted
arms:
</p><p>
"Be still, be still, I tell you! Let all things listen
for Him! He is here! Let the earth and the sea, let
even the sky be dumb! Listen!... It is He
who fills the universe, the very atoms sing with His
breath; He who illumines matter and chaos&mdash;<i>at which
the gods tremble</i>&mdash;just as the setting sun illumines that
dark cloud."
</p><p>
Julian listened. It seemed to him that the master's
calm weak voice was filling the world, was reaching
the heights of the heaven, and the last confines of the
sea. But the boy's sadness was so deep that it escaped
from his bosom in an involuntary sigh.
</p><p>
"Father, forgive me if the question is a folly; but
if it is thus with the world why go on living? Why
this eternal interchange of life and death? Why pain?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Why evil? Why the burden of the body? Why
doubt? Why this dark thirst for the impossible?"
</p><p>
Iamblicus looked at him with gentleness, and anew
passed his hand over Julian's head. He answered:
</p><p>
"Ah, my son, that is the very seat of the mystery!
there is no evil, there is no body, there is no universe,
if He exists! Think! it is He, <i>or</i> the universe! The
body, evil, the universe, all are a mirage, a deception
of the living senses. All we have once rested together
upon the breast of God in the bosom of invisible light.
But there came a time when we beheld from on high
matter in its darkness and deadness, and each of us saw
in matter its own image, as in a mirror. And the soul
mused to itself, 'I can, and I will to, be free! I am
like Him! Why not dare to quit Him and contain all
in myself?' So the soul, like Narcissus gazing into
the brook, fell under the spell of its own image, reflected
in its body; and then she fell farther, and
desired to fall for ever, to rend herself from God for ever.
She cannot do so. The feet of mortal man touch
earth, but his stature lifts him through the heavens.
</p><p>
"Upon the Eternal Ladder of births and of death,
all souls, all things existing, are ascending and descending,
sometimes towards Him, sometimes away
from Him, seeking to leave the Father, and never fulfilling
their endeavour. Each soul desires to be God.
It weeps for the breast of God, has no rest upon earth,
and aspires only to return to the Absolute. We must
return to Him, and then all things will become God,
and God will be in All. Do you imagine that you are
alone in regretting Him! Are you not aware that the
whole sum of things is yearning for Him? Listen!"
</p><p>
The sun had set. The edges of the flaming clouds
had sunk into ashes. The sea had become pale, light,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
flocculent as the sky; the sky deep and diaphanous as
the sea. Upon the road a cart was passing by; a
young man and woman were in it&mdash;two lovers, perhaps.
The woman was singing a melancholy love
song. When they had passed all things were plunged
into silence again, and became sadder still. With
hastened strides, the oriental night swept over the
earth. Julian murmured:
</p><p>
"How many times have I asked myself why Nature
was so sad, and why, when she is proudest then saddest
of all...."
</p><p>
Iamblicus answered by a smile&mdash;
</p><p>
"Yes... Yes... Look, she longs to say
why; and cannot speak. She is dumb. She
sleeps, and seeks to remember in her dreams, but
Matter weighs down her eyelids. Only vaguely can
she see Him. Everything in the universe, stars and
sea, and earth, animals, plants, and people are dreams of
Nature, thinking of God. What she so contemplates,
is born and dies. She creates by contemplation, as a
dream creates, with effortless ease, and no obstacle to
her thought. That is why her works are so beautiful,
so free, so purposeless, and so divine. The play of the
dreams of Nature is like the play of clouds, without
end or beginning. Outside that contemplation of hers
nothing in the world exists; and the deeper that contemplation
is, the more silent. Believe me, Will,
Action, Effort, are only enfeebled and deflected contemplations
of God. Nature, in her grandiose indolence,
creates forms like the geometrician, for whom
nothing exists except what he sees on the paper before
him. She brings forms, one after another, out of the
womb of her dream. But her mute meditation is only
the appearance of reality. Nature, that sleeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Cybele, never lifts her eyelids, and never finds words.
Man, he only, has found utterance. The human soul
is Nature having lifted the lashes of her eyes, awakened
and ready to see God, no longer in half-slumber,
but really and face to face...."
</p><p>
The first stars were shining in the firmament; now
they vanished, and now sparkled again into sight, like
diamonds set in the dark azure. More stars, and yet
more, kindled their new lights, till the array became
incalculable. Iamblicus lifted his finger towards
them&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian, to what should one compare the universe
of all those stars? One might liken it to a fisherman's
net thrown into the sea. God fills the universe as the
water fills the net, which moves, but which cannot retain
the waters; and the universe desires, but cannot
keep God in her meshes. The net is drawn, but God
remains. If the universe made no stir God would
create nothing&mdash;would not issue from the calm that
surrounds Him. For whither should He sweep, and
to what end? Yonder, in the realm of the eternal
Mothers, in the soul of Calm, dwell the seeds, the
Forms, the Ideas, of all that is, has been, and shall be.
The germ of hearth-cricket and of atom, together with
the germ of the Olympian god."
</p><p>
Then Julian cried aloud, and his voice rang in the
silence of Nature like a cry of mortal pain&mdash;
</p><p>
"But who then is He; why does He not answer
when we call Him? What is His name? I wish to
know, I desire to know Him, to hear Him&mdash;to see Him&mdash;why
does He escape my thought? Where is He?
Where does He dwell?"
</p><p>
"My poor boy! What matters thought to Him?
What means it? He has no name. He is such, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
we can say that He must exist, but it is impossible for
us to say what He is. But do you think that you can
suffer love, or curse Him, without singing His praises?
The All-Creator is Himself, having no likeness to His
creations. When you say, '<i>He is not</i>,' you are exalting
Him as much as if you said '<i>He is</i>.' One can
affirm nothing about Him, because He is above existence,
reality, and life. That is why I have said to you
that He is the negation of the universe and of your
thought. Deny, renounce all that exists for us here,
and yonder, in the soundless profundity of darkness,
as in the light, you shall find Him still. Give Him
friends, family, country, heaven, earth, yourself, your
reason, then you will no longer see light, you shall
yourself be it. You will not say, 'He and I,' because
you will feel that He and you are '<i>one</i>'; and your
soul will smile at your body as at a phantasm of the
desert. You shall become silence, you shall no more
find utterance. And if at that moment the world
should crumble away, you would be happy: for what
would the world signify to you, since you shall be with
Him? Your soul shall not desire, because He has no
desires; it shall no longer live, because He is above
living; it shall no longer think, because He is above
thought. Thought is the search for light. He seeks
not, because He is Himself the light. He penetrates
the whole soul&mdash;He laps it in Himself. And then, impartial
and solitary, it rests above reason higher than
goodness, higher than beauty, reposes in the infinite,
on the breast of God the Father of Light. The Soul
becomes God, or, to put it better, it remembers that in
the night of ages it has been, is, and shall be, God....
Such, my son, is the life of the Olympians;
such is the life of the wise and heroic among men;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
renunciation of the universe, contempt of earthly passions,
the flight of the Soul towards God, whom at last
it sees face to face."
</p><p>
Iamblicus ceased speaking. Julian fell at his feet
without daring to touch them, and kissed the earth
where they rested. Then he raised his head and gazed
into those strange green eyes, in which dwelt the wisdom
of the serpent. They appeared calmer and deeper
than the sky, and as if exhaling a miraculous power.
</p><p>
Julian murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Master! thou canst do all things. I believe!
Command the mountains, and they shall approach
each other! Be like God. Work a miracle, create
the impossible. Grant my prayer! I believe!"
</p><p>
"My poor boy, what are you asking for? Is not the
miracle which may be accomplished in your soul more
beautiful than any wonders which <i>I</i> can work? Son,
is it not a terrible and a happy miracle, this power in
the name of which you can dare to say: 'He is,' and
if 'He is not' it matters nothing, '<i>He will be</i>,' and
you say 'Let God exist! Amen, so be it!'"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VIII</h2>

<p>When Iamblicus and Julian, returning from their
walk, were crossing Panormos, the crowded
harbour-quarter of Ephesus, they noticed an unusual
tumult; folk running hither and thither, waving
torches and shouting&mdash;
</p><p>
"The Christians are destroying the temples! Woe
be on us!" and others: "Death to the Olympian
gods! Astarte is vanquished by Christ!"
</p><p>
Iamblicus attempted a detour through less frequented
streets, but the howling mob caught and swept them in
its course towards the temple of the Ephesian Artemis.
The superb temple, built by Dynocrates, stood out
sharply, dark and austere, against the starry sky. The
gleam of the torches flickered up gigantic colonnades,
pedestalled on beautiful little groups of caryatids. Up
to this period, not only the Romans, but all tribes in
the country had adored this goddess. Someone in the
crowd cried out in a quavering voice&mdash;
</p><p>
"Hail to the divine Diana of the Ephesians!"
</p><p>
Hundreds of voices responded&mdash;
</p><p>
"Death to the Olympians and to your Diana!"
</p><p>
Above the Arsenal and its towering monument rose
a blood-red light. Julian glanced at his divine master,
and scarcely recognised him. Iamblicus was transformed
back into a sickly and timid old man. He
complained of headache, expressed his fear of an attack
of rheumatism, and doubted whether his servant had
not forgotten to prepare his fomentations. Julian lent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
him his own cloak; but he remained chilly, and stopped
his ears, with a dolorous grimace, against the shouts
and laughter of the crowd, which he dreaded. Iamblicus
used to say there was nothing more stupid and disgusting
than the spirit of the people. He pointed out
to his pupil the faces hurrying past&mdash;
</p><p>
"Look at the monstrous vice in that expression!
What hopeless triviality! what self-confident assertion!...
Does it not make one ashamed of being
human, to share human form with mud like that!"
</p><p>
An old Christian woman hobbled along, telling a
story&mdash;
</p><p>
"And my grandson, he says to me, 'Grandmother,
make me some meat-broth.' Well, I tell him, 'Yes,
darling, I'll go to the market soon,' and to myself I'm
thinking meat is nowadays cheaper than bread. So I
buy some meat for five obols and have it cooked. And
in comes a neighbour and screams at me, 'What are
you cooking there? Don't you know that the meat of
the market is not fit to touch to-day?'
</p><p>
"'Why so?'
</p><p>
"'The priests of the goddess have sprinkled the
whole market with water from the sacrifices! There's
not a Christian in the town eating the meat so spoiled.
And they're going to kill the sacrificers, and pull
down the devilish temple!'
</p><p>
"I threw the broth to the dogs; just think! five
obols, all wasted!&mdash;more than a day's wage thrown
away&mdash;but all the same I wouldn't make my own
grandson unclean!"
</p><p>
Others were telling how, in the previous year, some
miserly Christian had eaten of the impure meat, which
had so rotted his intestines that his very relatives had
had to abandon him, on account of the contagion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
</p><p>
In the public square rose a beautiful little temple to
Diana-Selene-Ph&oelig;be-Astarte&mdash;the triple goddess Hecate,
mother of the gods. Like enormous wasps greedily
intent upon a honeycomb, monks had surrounded the
temple on all sides, crawling along the lovely white
cornice, clambering up ladders, and to the chant of
psalms, smashing the statues and bas-reliefs.
</p><p>
The columns were trembling on their bases, fragments
of marble flying in all directions. The delicate
edifice seemed to wince like a living creature. Finally
an attempt was made to set the temple on fire; but as
it was wholly built of marble, all efforts in this direction
were fruitless.
</p><p>
Suddenly a strange noise rang out from the interior,
a deafening and resonant series of shocks, while
triumphant howls of the crowd rose to the sky.
</p><p>
"Bring ropes, ropes! Hide her immodest limbs!"
</p><p>
In a hubbub of hymns and wild laughter the mob, by
means of ropes, dragged out of the temple the superb
silver body of the goddess, which had been moulded
by Scopas. Step by step, it came thundering down.
</p><p>
"Cast her in the fire! in the fire!"
</p><p>
The figure was dragged into the muddy market-place.
There a monk was declaiming a passage from
the celebrated edict of Constantine II, the brother of
Constantius&mdash;
</p><p>
"'Let there be an end of superstition, and let sacrifices
be abolished' (<i>Cesset superstitio sacrificiorum, aboleatur
insania!</i>).
</p><p>
"Fear nothing; break, sack, plunder everything in
that temple of demons!" Another was reading by
torchlight from a parchment scroll the following words
from the book <i>De errore profanarum religionum</i>, by
Firmicus Maternus&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
</p><p>
"Divine Emperors! Come! succour the unfortunate
heathen. Let us snatch them by force from hell
rather than leave them to perish. Seize the temple-ornaments
and let their riches feed your treasury. Let
him who sacrifices to idols be torn from the earth, root
and branch (<i>Sacrificans diis eradicabitur</i>). Thou shalt
deliver him to death; thou shalt stone him with stones,
were that offender thy son, thy brother, or the wife
that sleeps upon thy heart!"
</p><p>
And over the crowd swept the exultant shout&mdash;
</p><p>
"Death! Death to the gods of Olympus!"
</p><p>
An Arian monk of gigantic stature, his lank black
hair plastered to his sweaty face, heaved an axe above
the goddess, seeking where to strike.
</p><p>
A voice advised&mdash;
</p><p>
"In the belly! In her abominable belly!"
</p><p>
The great silver body rolled over mutilated; the
blows rang pitiless, leaving gaps bitten in the metal.
</p><p>
An old pagan stood by and veiled his face from the
sacrilege. He was secretly weeping at the thought
that now the end of the world, the end of everything,
was come, for the earth would no longer bring forth a
blade of corn.
</p><p>
A hermit from the deserts of Mesopotamia, clothed
in sheepskin, wearing coarse sandals and an empty
gourd slung from his shoulder, stood over the statue,
sheep-crook in hand&mdash;
</p><p>
"This forty years I have never washed, that I might
not see my nakedness, nor fall into temptation. And
yet coming into cities, straight one perceives these accursed
gods without a rag upon them. How long
must we endure these devilish temptations! At the
hearth, in the street, on the roof, in the baths, these
idols everywhere above one's head?... Faugh!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Faugh! Faugh! How can I spit enough disgust on
things like these?"
</p><p>
The old man spurned the prostrate woman's form
with his sandal in energetic horror; stamped on the
bare breast as if it were alive, and kept scoring it with
the sharp nails of his sandals, stuttering with rage&mdash;
</p><p>
"Take that, and that&mdash;and that, O foul immodesty!"
</p><p>
The lips of the goddess lay with their calm smile
under the soles of his feet.
</p><p>
The crowd began to haul the statue upright in order
to tilt it into the bonfire. Drunken garlic-smelling apprentices
spat in the metal face. An enormous blaze,
built of the massed wreckage of market-booths, quickly
arose. The statue was dropped into the flames to be
melted into silver bullion.
</p><p>
"There are five talents' worth! think&mdash;thirty thousand
pieces of silver! We'll send half to the Emperor
to pay the army, and take the other half for famished
folk here. Cybele will bring solace to mankind at
last, anyhow! Thirty thousand pieces of silver for the
soldiers and the poor!"
</p><p>
"Bring fuel, more wood!" The flame mounted
still more fiercely; the mob burst into laughter.
</p><p>
"We'll see whether the devil flies out of her!
There's a demon in every idol, you know, and two or
three inside goddesses!"
</p><p>
"When she begins to melt it'll get too hot for the
devil, and he'll come wriggling out of her mouth like
a red serpent!"
</p><p>
"No! you must make the sign of the cross beforehand.
If you don't, he can glide into the earth. Last
year, when we pulled down the temple of Aphrodite,
someone sprinkled her with holy water and&mdash;can you
believe it?&mdash;a whole flight of devilets scampered away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
from underneath the statue&mdash;I saw them myself&mdash;green
and black and hairy all over! And when the head was
broken open the big devil came out of her neck, with
great horns and a tail as bald as a mangy dog!"
</p><p>
At this moment Iamblicus, half dead with terror,
seized Julian by the hand and dragged him away&mdash;
</p><p>
"Look! Do you see those two men? They are
spies sent by Constantius. Your brother Gallus has
been taken under escort to Constantinople. Be careful;
this very day there will be a report sent in as to
how you bear yourself."
</p><p>
"But what is there to be done, Master? I am well
accustomed to it; for years they have kept spies about
me."
</p><p>
"For years! Why have you said nothing of it to
me?"
</p><p>
The hand of Iamblicus shook within that of Julian.
</p><p>
"Why are those two whispering together? Look at
them&mdash;they must be pagans.... Now then old
man, hurry up, bring wood!" cried out a ragged rascal
in a triumphant tone.
</p><p>
Iamblicus whispered into Julian's ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let us despise it all, and in contempt resign
ourselves. Human stupidity can never hurt the
gods!"
</p><p>
So saying the "Divine" Iamblicus took an enormous
faggot from the hands of the Christian and cast it into
the fire. At first Julian could scarcely believe his
eyes. The now-smiling spies stared at him, with a
curious fixity.
</p><p>
Then weakness, and his own habitual hypocrisy for
his own sake and for the sake of others, won the day.
He went to the heap of wood, chose the largest log,
and, after Iamblicus, threw it into the blaze in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the mutilated body of the goddess was already melting.
He clearly saw drops of silver rolling on her face as in
a death-sweat, and the lips still keeping their invincible
smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">IX</h2>

<p>"Look at those fellows dressed in black, Julian!
They are shadows of night-fall, shadows of
death. Soon there will not be a single ancient white
robe left, nor a single sun-steeped piece of marble....
All is over!"
</p><p>
So spoke the young sophist, Antoninus, son of the
prophetess Sospitra and of Ædesius, the Neo-Platonist.
He was standing with Julian on the terrace of the
temple of Pergamos, in bright sunshine, under a sky
of cloudless blue. Along the foot of the balustrade
was carven the revolt of the Titans. The gods were
triumphing; and the hoofs of the winged horses crushing
the serpent bodies of the antique giants. Antoninus
pointed to the carving&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah! Julian, the Olympians conquered the Titans,
but now the Olympians in their turn will be beaten by
barbaric gods. These temples will become tombs...."
</p><p>
Antoninus was a handsome youth, straight-limbed
as one of the old statues, but his health had been
broken for years by an incurable malady, and his face
had become yellow, lean, and melancholy.
</p><p>
"I pray the gods," went on Antoninus, "I entreat
the gods not to suffer me to see that night&mdash;that I may
die before it comes. Rhetoricians, sophists, poets,
sages, artists, none of us are wanted any more. We
are born in too late a day.... All is over for us!"
</p><p>
"And suppose you are mistaken?" hazarded Julian.
</p><p>
"No, all's over! We are not as our forefathers!
We are sick, strength fails us."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian's face seemed as worn and haggard as that of
Antoninus. The projecting lower lip gave him an expression
of taciturn arrogance. The thick eyebrows
were knitted in bitter obstinacy; precocious wrinkles
already furrowed his cheeks. The long nose had
grown longer than ever; and his always strange eyes
were now burning with a dry, feverish, disagreeable
fire. He still wore the monkish habit. During the
day he still attended church, as hitherto; worshipped
relics; read the gospels in public, and was preparing
to take orders. Sometimes all this hypocrisy seemed
to him worse than useless. He foresaw that Gallus
would not escape a premature death, and knew that he
himself might expect it at any moment.
</p><p>
But his nights Julian was wont to pass in the great
library of Pergamos, where he was studying the works
of the great foe of Christianity, Libanius. He attended
the lectures of the Greek sophists, Ædesius of Pergamos,
Chrisantius of Sardinia, Priscius of Thesephros,
Eusebius of Minos, Pr&oelig;res, and Nymphidian. These
taught him much about what he had already heard
from Iamblicus, of the <i>triad</i> of the Neo-Platonists, and
of the "divine ecstasy." He said to himself&mdash;
</p><p>
"All that is not what I am seeking; they are hiding
something from me!"
</p><p>
Priscius, imitating Pythagoras, had passed five years
in silence, keeping to a vegetarian diet, and using
neither raiment of wool nor sandal of leather. He
wore a cloak of pure white linen and sandals of palm
leaves stitched together.
</p><p>
"In our age," he used to say, "the thing of moment
is to be able to hold one's tongue, and to meditate
on dying worthily."
</p><p>
Thus Priscius, despising all things, awaited what he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
called the catastrophe, that is to say, the complete
victory of Christianity over the Hellenists.
</p><p>
The wily and prudent Chrisantius, when the subject of
the gods was touched on, would cast his eyes to heaven,
avowing that he dared not talk about them, knowing
nothing, and having forgotten what he had learnt on
the subject. And he advised others to follow his own
example. As for magic, miracles, and phantasms, he
would hear nothing about them, declaring that they were
criminal deceptions, forbidden by the Imperial laws.
</p><p>
Julian had no appetite, slept ill; his blood was boiling
with passion and impatience. Every morning on
awaking he would wonder&mdash;
</p><p>
"Is it to be to-day?"
</p><p>
He would worry the poor sages with ceaseless questions
concerning mysteries and miracles. Some of
them he shocked, especially Chrisantius, who was in
the habit of acquiescence in all the opinions which
seemed to him most foolish.
</p><p>
On one occasion Ædesius, a timid and learned old
man, pitying Julian, said to him&mdash;
</p><p>
"My boy, I want to die quietly; you are young
yet. Leave me alone. Address yourself to my disciples;
they will reveal to you everything I have
taught. Yes, there are many things about which we
are afraid to speak, and when you shall have been
initiated into the greater mysteries, you will perhaps
be ashamed at having been born a mere mortal, and of
having remained one up till now."
</p><p>
Euthemus of Minda, a disciple of Ædesius, and a
jealous and malicious fellow, declared to Julian:
"There are no more such things as miracles. Don't
expect any. Men have badgered the gods too long.
Magic is a lie, and those who believe in it are idiots.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
But if you are still hungry for wisdom, and absolutely
must have illusions, go to Maximus. He despises our
dialectical philosophy, and yet himself.... But I don't
like speaking ill of my friends. Just hear, however,
what happened lately in a temple of Hecate whither
Maximus had conducted us to prove his art. When
we had gone in and adored the goddess, he said to us:
'Sit down, and you shall see a miracle.' We sat down.
He threw on the altar a phimian-seed, muttering something,&mdash;a
hymn I suppose,&mdash;and then we saw the statue
of Hecate smile at us! Maximus said to us: 'Fear
nothing when you shall see the two torches held by
the goddess kindle of themselves. Behold!' Before
he had finished the sentence the lamps were alight,
self-kindled!"
</p><p>
"The miracle, in fact, was accomplished!" cried
Julian.
</p><p>
"Yes; our emotion was so great that we prostrated
ourselves. But when I came out of the temple I asked
myself, 'Is what Maximus does worthy of true philosophy?'
Read Pythagoras, Plato&mdash;there shall you
find wisdom. By divine dialectic to lift the heart of
man&mdash;is not that finer than any miracle?"
</p><p>
But Julian was listening no more; his eyes sparkled
as he gazed at the surly face of Euthemus, and he
murmured as he went forth from the school&mdash;
</p><p>
"Keep your books and your dialectics! I seek life
and faith! Can they exist without miracles? I thank
thee, Euthemus, thou hast pointed me to the man I
have sought for long."
</p><p>
With a bitter smile the sophist answered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Nephew of Constantine, you have not improved
upon your ancestors. Miracles were not necessary to
the faith of Socrates!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">X</h2>

<p>At the stroke of midnight, in the vestibule leading
to the great hall of the mysteries, Julian flung
off his novice's robe. The sacrificial mystagogues,
initiators into the pagan ceremonial, then clothed him
anew in their own priestly tunic, woven of threads of
papyrus. A palm-branch was put into his hand, and
his feet were left bare. He was then led up a long low
hall, the vaults of which were supported by a double
row of bronze Corinthian columns. Each column,
formed of two serpents entwined, bore two incense-burners
on lofty and slender branching stands, whence
rose thin tongues of flame. Dense vapour filled the
hall. At its end glittered two winged golden bulls,
propping a splendid throne, on which was seated,
arrayed in a long black tunic powdered thick with
emeralds and carbuncles, and in demeanour like a god,
the greatest hierophant of all, Maximus of Ephesus.
</p><p>
The slow reverberant voice of a temple slave announced
the opening of the mysteries&mdash;
</p><p>
"If any impious, or Christian, or Epicurean be present
in this assembly, let him go forth!"
</p><p>
Instructed in advance as to the necessary responses,
Julian pronounced the words&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let the Christians go forth!"
</p><p>
The choir of temple slaves, hidden in obscurity,
took up the burden&mdash;
</p><p>
"To the doors! To the doors! Let the Christians
go forth! Let the impious go forth!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
</p><p>
Then twenty-four lads, entirely naked, each holding
a silver sistrum, like a crescent-moon, came forth from
the shadow. In perfect unison they raised the vibrating
instruments above their heads, and with one graceful
gesture struck the resonant strings, which gave
forth a long and plaintive note. Maximus made a sign.
</p><p>
Someone tightly bandaged Julian's eyes from behind
and said to him earnestly&mdash;
</p><p>
"Go forward! Fear neither Water, Fire, Spirits;
nor Bodies, nor Life, nor Death."
</p><p>
He felt himself dragged forward; an iron door
opened on creaking hinges. He was pushed through
it; a stifling atmosphere beat on his face while his
feet groped down slippery and twisted steps. Feeling
his way down this endless stair, amidst sepulchral
silence, it seemed at last that he must be a great
distance underground. He proceeded along a narrow
passage&mdash;so narrow that his hands, held stiffly to his
sides, rubbed along the walls. Suddenly his bare feet
struck moisture; he heard water flowing; a stream
covered his ankles. He kept on, but at every step the
water rose, reaching first his calves, then his knees,
and finally his loins. His teeth began to chatter
with cold. The flood rose breast high. He wondered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Perhaps this is a trap; it is some device of Maximus
for killing me, to do the Emperor pleasure."
</p><p>
But he held stoutly on, forging slowly through the
water. Finally it seemed to lessen, till at last it completely
ebbed away. A suffocating heat, as from the
mouth of a furnace, gradually enveloped him, so that
the ground scorched his feet. Julian thought he must
be walking straight into an oven; blood throbbed in
his temples; sometimes the heat was so intense that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
licked his cheek like a flame. But the lad never
wavered.
</p><p>
In its turn the heat diminished. But sickening
odours next choked his breath. Time after time he
stumbled against round objects, and recognised bones
and dead men's skulls.
</p><p>
Suddenly he felt someone walking by his side, gliding
along noiselessly like a shadow; an ice-cold hand
seized his own. He uttered an involuntary cry. Two
hands were gently pulling at his clothes, the fleshless
bones piercing their withered skin. The grip of these
hands became playful movements, repulsive caresses
like those of debauched women. Julian felt a breath
on his cheek tainted with fusty rottenness and moisture,
and then became aware of a rapid murmur at his
ear, like the rustle of leaves on a night in autumn&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is I! It is I!&mdash;I!&mdash;do you not know me
again? It is I!&mdash;I!"
</p><p>
"And who, who art thou?" stammered Julian. But
immediately he recollected his promise of absolute
silence.
</p><p>
"It is I! Shall I strip the bandage from your eyes
so that you may know me again, may meet me again?"
And the bony fingers, with the same hideous eagerness,
fluttered over his face as if seeking to drag off the
bandage.
</p><p>
A deadly chill penetrated Julian to the heart, and,
through habit, he thrice crossed himself involuntarily,
as in childhood at some bad dream.
</p><p>
A clap of thunder! The ground heaved under his
feet! He felt himself falling into the unknown; and
lost consciousness.
</p><p>
When he regained his senses he was no longer blindfold
but lay on cushions in a huge twilit grotto. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
cloth, soaked in penetrating perfumes, was being held
to his nostrils. Opposite Julian stood a lean man with
a coppery skin; it was the gymnosophist&mdash;the naked
sage&mdash;assistant of Maximus.
</p><p>
He was holding high above his head a motionless
metallic disc. A voice said to Julian. "Look!"
Julian gazed at the dazzling circle. Its brilliancy was
almost painful to the eyes. Looking at it fixedly and
long, gradually all things melted and lost their sharper
outline. A pleasant weakness breathed through his
being. The luminous disc no longer shone in the void,
but in his own mind; his eyelids descended; a sleepy
smile of weariness played upon his submissive lips.
He felt a hand stroking his head, and a voice
asked&mdash;
</p><p>
"Are you asleep?"
</p><p>
"Yes...."
</p><p>
"Look me in the eyes!"
</p><p>
Julian obeyed with effort and perceived Maximus
stooping over him.
</p><p>
He was a man of about seventy years old, bearded
to the girdle. Thick hair, with a yellow glitter in it,
fell thick over his shoulders. Deep wrinkles, furrowed
by thought and will, and not by suffering, marked
cheek and brow. His smile was like the smile of
women who are at once witty, mendacious, and enchanting.
But it was the eyes of Maximus that gave
Julian most pleasure. Under thick eyebrows they
shone mocking, and tender, yet piercing to the quick.
</p><p>
Maximus asked&mdash;"Do you wish to see the most
famous of the Titans?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"Watch then."
</p><p>
The magician pointed to the depth of the cave where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
stood a tripod of Corinthian bronze, vomiting smoke.
A tempestuous noise filled the cavern&mdash;
</p><p>
"Hercules! Hercules! Deliver me!"
</p><p>
The smoke vanished; blue sky appeared. Julian
lay stretched motionless and pale, watching through
half-shut eyelids the rapid visions unfolded before him.
It was as if someone commanded him to see them.
He beheld clouds and snow-clad mountains, and heard
the breaking of distant waves. Slowly he perceived
an enormous body, chained hand and foot to crags. A
kite was devouring the liver of the Titan, drops of
black blood trickled down his side; the great chains
rattled, and the whole body shuddered with pain.
</p><p>
"Deliver me, Hercules!"
</p><p>
And the Titan raised his shaggy head; his eyes met
those of the youth entranced&mdash;
</p><p>
"Who art thou? Whom dost thou summon?"
asked Julian, speaking heavily in his dream.
</p><p>
"I call on thee!"
</p><p>
"I am but a mortal, and helpless."
</p><p>
"Thou art my brother; set me free!"
</p><p>
"Who has chained thee up anew?"
</p><p>
"The humble, the gentle,&mdash;who through cowardice
forgive their enemies. Slaves! slaves!... O deliver
me!"
</p><p>
"How can I deliver thee?"
</p><p>
"Be even as I am."
</p><p>
The smoke of the tripod obscured the apparition.
Julian woke for a moment and the great hierophant,
the teacher of rites, asked&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do you wish to see the ruined Archangel?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"Behold him!"
</p><p>
In the white smoke appeared faintly a head between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
two gigantic wings. The feathers of the wings swept
out, drooping like branches of yew, and a bluish tint
as of some lost sky trembled upon the melancholy
plumes.
</p><p>
Someone cried to Julian from afar off&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian! Julian! Deny the Galilean in my
name!"
</p><p>
Julian held his peace.
</p><p>
Maximus muttered at his ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"If you wish to see the great Angel you must make
this renunciation."
</p><p>
And Julian pronounced the words&mdash;
</p><p>
"I deny Him!"
</p><p>
Above the head of the apparition suddenly glittered
the morning star&mdash;the star of dawn&mdash;and the Angel
repeated&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian, deny the Galilean in my name!"
</p><p>
A third time the Angel repeated,&mdash;and his voice
sounded exultant and close by: "Renounce Him!"
</p><p>
And Julian answered&mdash;
</p><p>
"I renounce Him!"
</p><p>
The Angel said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Thou mayest approach."
</p><p>
"Who art thou?"
</p><p>
"I am Lucifer, I am Light, I am the East, I am the
Morning Star!"
</p><p>
"How beautiful thou art!"
</p><p>
"Be thou as I am."
</p><p>
"What melancholy dwells in thine eyes!"
</p><p>
"I suffer for all living. Birth must cease, death
must cease. Come to me; I am the Shadow, I am
Repose, I am Liberty."
</p><p>
"How art thou named among men?"
</p><p>
"Evil."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
</p><p>
"Thou?"
</p><p>
"Yes. I turned in revolt."
</p><p>
"Against whom?"
</p><p>
"Against Him whose peer I am. He willed to be
alone, but we are two, and equals."
</p><p>
"Make me in thine image!"
</p><p>
"Revolt also! I will give thee the thews for rebellion."
</p><p>
"Teach me!"
</p><p>
"Violate the law, love thyself, curse Him, and be as
I am!"
</p><p>
The Angel disappeared; the wind in circling gusts
rekindled the flame on the tripod. The flame blew
over the brim of the vessel and ran along the ground.
The tripod itself was overset, and the flame went out.
In the darkness came a rushing noise of numberless
steps, with cries and groanings, as if an invisible army,
fleeing before an enemy, were in passage through the
cave. Julian, in terror, fell face downward to the
earth, while the long black robe of the hierophant,
stretched over him, struggled with the wind.
</p><p>
"Flee, flee!" groaned indistinct voices. "The gates
of Hell are opening; it is He, He, the Conqueror!"
</p><p>
The wind hissed in Julian's ears; legions upon
legions seemed passing over him; suddenly there fell a
dead calm; a heavenly breath filled the vast cavern
and a voice murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
</p><p>
It seemed to Julian that he had heard that voice before,
in some far time of childhood. Gently it came again&mdash;
</p><p>
"Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?"
</p><p>
And the sound faded away into the distance, so that
there came at last but an imperceptible whisper:
"Why, why, persecutest thou me?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
</p><p>
When Julian awoke and raised his prostrate face he
saw one of the initiating priests lighting a lamp. He
felt giddy, but remembered exactly everything that
had taken place. His eyes were blindfolded and,
strengthened with spiced wine, he was enabled to
climb the staircase, his hand gripped this time by the
strong hand of Maximus. He felt as if an invisible
force was lifting him on wings. The teacher of rites
said to the lad&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now ask what you will!"
</p><p>
"Did you summon Him?" inquired Julian.
</p><p>
"No. But when one chord of the lyre vibrates,
another chord responds. Opposite answers opposite."
</p><p>
"Why is there such potency in His words if His
words are only lies?"
</p><p>
"His words are truth."
</p><p>
"What do you mean? Then it is the Titan and the
Angel who lied?"
</p><p>
"They also are the truth."
</p><p>
"Do you mean that there are two truths?"
</p><p>
"Two truths."
</p><p>
"Ah! You are tempting me!..."
</p><p>
"Not I, but the wholeness of the truth. If you are
afraid, be silent."
</p><p>
"I am afraid of nothing. Say on; tell all! Are
the Galileans right?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"Why then should I have renounced them?"
</p><p>
"There is, beside theirs, another truth."
</p><p>
"One higher?"
</p><p>
"No, equal."
</p><p>
"But in what is one to believe? Where is the God
whom I seek?"
</p><p>
"Both here and yonder. Serve Ahriman,&mdash;serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Ormuzd, whichever pleases you! But forget not that
both are equal,&mdash;the kingdom of Lucifer and the kingdom
of God."
</p><p>
"Which way should I choose?"
</p><p>
"Choose one of the two roads, and halt no more!"
</p><p>
"But which?"
</p><p>
"If you believe in Him, take up the cross. Follow
Him according to His command; be humble, chaste.
Be the lamb that was dumb between the hands of the
shearers. Flee into the desert for salvation; give Him
body, soul, and reason! Believe!... that is one way.
And the Galilean martyrs attain the same liberty that
Prometheus and Lucifer have attained."
</p><p>
"That way I cannot choose."
</p><p>
"Choose then the other path. Be puissant as your
ancestors of old, the heroes&mdash;proud, pitiless, and
haughty. No compassion! No love! No pardon!
Arise and conquer all things! Let your body become
hard as marble out of which the demigods are hewn!
Take and give not! Taste of the forbidden fruit and
repent not! Believe not, doubt not, and the world
shall be thine! Thou shalt be the Titan&mdash;an angel
revolted against God."
</p><p>
"But I can never forget that the words of the Galilean
contain truth also. I cannot admit two beliefs."
</p><p>
"Then thou shalt be like all common mortals and
hadst better never been born; but thou canst choose.
Make the venture!... Thou shalt be emperor!"
</p><p>
"I? Emperor?"
</p><p>
"Thou shalt have between thy hands what Alexander
never had."
</p><p>
Julian felt that they were issuing from the bowels of
the earth, felt the morning sea-breeze bathing him.
The hierophant unknotted the bandage over his eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
and lo! they were standing on a high marble tower,
the astronomical observatory of the great seer, built
after the model of the ancient Chaldean towers, but
upon a crag above the sea. Below stretched luxurious
gardens, palaces, and cloisters, recalling the colonnades
of Persepolis. In the distance the Artemision and
Ephesus stood in clear relief against the mountains
over which the sun was about to rise.
</p><p>
Julian's head almost gave way at the extent of the
view; he had to lean upon the arm of Maximus; but
then with a smile the youth closed his eyes, and the
beams of the rising sun flushed his white vestments
with rose-colour. The seer stretched out his arm.
</p><p>
"Behold! all this is thine!"
</p><p>
"Can I sustain it, Master? Assassination may
strike me at any moment. I am weak and ill."
</p><p>
"The sun, the god Mithra, is crowning you with his
purples&mdash;the purple of the Roman Empire. All this is
thine. Dare!"
</p><p>
"And what is it all to me, since truth unified does
not exist, and since I cannot find the God for whom I
seek?"
</p><p>
"Ah! if thou canst make one the truth of the Titan
and the truth of the Galilean, thou wilt be greater
than any that have been born of women!..."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Maximus of Ephesus was the owner of marvellous
libraries, quiet marble chambers, and spacious anatomical
laboratories crowded with scientific apparatus.
In one of the latter the young physicist, Oribazius, a
doctor of the school of Alexandria, was vivisecting,
scalpel in hand, a rare animal sent to Maximus from the
Indies. The hall was circular and the walls loaded with
rows of tin vessels, chafing dishes, retorts, apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
like that of Archimedes, and fire machines like
those of Ktesius and Geron. In the silence of the adjoining
library drop after drop fell plashing from the
water-clock, an invention of Apollonius. Globes were
there also, geographical charts in metal, and models
of the celestial spheres wrought by Hipparchus and
Eratosthenes.
</p><p>
In the clear and serene light falling through the
glass ceiling, Maximus, clothed as a simple philosopher,
was scrutinising the still-warm organs of the
animal laid on the marble. Oribazius stooping over
the liver of the animal was saying&mdash;
</p><p>
"How can Maximus, the great philosopher, believe
in these ridiculous miracles?"
</p><p>
"I believe in them and I believe in them not,"
answered the magian. "This Nature which you and
I are studying, is not she most miraculous? Are not
these blood-vessels, this nervous system, the admirable
combination of organs which we are examining like
augurs&mdash;are not these the most splendid of mysteries?"
</p><p>
"You know my meaning," interrupted the young
doctor. "Why have you deceived this young man?"
</p><p>
"Julian?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"He himself desired to be deceived."
</p><p>
The brows of Oribazius knitted into a frown.
</p><p>
"Master, if you love me, tell me who you are. How
can you endure lies like these? Do I not understand
what magic means? You attach luminous fish-scales
to the ceiling of a darkened chamber, and the pupil to
be initiated believes that the skies are descending on
him at the word of the hierophant. You manufacture
with skin and wax a death's head, into which you fit a
stork's neck; and through it you pronounce your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
predictions from beneath the floor. The pupil imagines
that the skull uncurtains to him the secrets of the
tomb; and when it is necessary that the head should
vanish, you bring a chafing dish near it, the wax melts
and the skull collapses. By skilful rays of coloured
light playing on odorous smoke, you make the innocent
believe that they have verily seen the gods! You
display under water in a basin, of which the walls are
stone and the bottom glass, a living Apollo (acted by an
obliging slave), while some vulgar prostitute is played
off as Aphrodite. This&mdash;this, you call the holy mysteries!"
</p><p>
His habitual equivocal smile wandered over the compressed
lips of the teacher, who answered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah! our mysteries are deeper and finer than you
suppose. Men have absolute need of enthusiasm. For
him who has faith the harlot is Aphrodite really, and
the luminous scales are the stars of heaven. You say
that people weep and pray before semblances produced
by a lamp and coloured glasses? Oribazius, Oribazius!...
but this Nature which makes your science marvel,
is she not herself a mirage, produced by senses as deceptive
as the wizard's lantern? Wherein does truth
consist? Where does falsehood begin? You believe
and you know, and I neither wish to believe nor am
skilled to know. Truth dwells for me in the same
shrine as falsehood."
</p><p>
"Would Julian thank you, if he knew that you were
deceiving him?"
</p><p>
"He saw what he desired to see. I have given him
enthusiasm, strength, and audacity. You say that I
have deceived him. If that had been necessary I
would have done so&mdash;I would have tempted him.
I love the falsehood that contains a truth. I love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
temptation. Till I die I will never abandon Julian
and shall allow him to taste all forbidden fruits. He
is young; I shall live on a second life in him. I will
unveil for him the mystery and charm even of crime;
and perhaps through me he shall become great!"
</p><p>
"Master, I do not understand you."
</p><p>
"And that is precisely why I speak thus to you,"
responded Maximus, fixing on Oribazius his penetrating
and impassive eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XI</h2>

<p>Julian had an interview with his brother Gallus
while the latter was on his way to Constantinople.
He had found him surrounded by a troop of traitors in
the pay of Constantius: the quæstor Leontinus, a wily
courtier, famous for skill in eavesdropping and cross-examining
servants; the tribune Baïnobadois, a taciturn
barbarian, who gave the impression of an over-tragic
actor playing the part of a headsman; the Emperor's
haughty Master of Ceremonies, <i>comes domesticorum</i>,
Lucilian; and finally Marcus Scuda, the former
tribune of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, who, thanks to the
protection of certain old ladies, had attained the post
he longed for.
</p><p>
Gallus, now, as always, gay and giddy, had offered
Julian an excellent supper, of which the chief feature
was a plump pheasant stuffed with fresh Theban dates.
He laughed like a child, and was calling up all sorts
of reminiscences of old days together at Macellum,
when suddenly Julian spoke to him about his wife
Constantia.
</p><p>
The face of Gallus fell; his eyes filled with tears,
and he laid down on his plate the succulent piece of
pheasant which he had been on the point of putting
into his mouth.
</p><p>
"Don't you know, Julian, that Constantia is dead?
She died unexpectedly after an attack of tertian ague,
on the very journey to the Emperor which she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
undertaken to absolve me from blame in his eyes. I
wept for two whole nights when I heard that news."
</p><p>
He cast a timid glance at the door, put his hand on
Julian's shoulder, and whispered confidentially&mdash;
</p><p>
"Since then, I have let things go to the devil! She
alone might have saved me. Ah! she was an astonishing
woman. Without her I am ruined. I can do, and
I can learn, nothing.... 'They' do with me just as
they please."
</p><p>
He tossed off a cup of wine at a gulp.
</p><p>
Julian remembered Constantia, the sister of Constantius,
a widow of ripe age, the evil genius of her brother,
her who had incited him to commit numberless crimes,
crimes which were frequently mere fatuous stupidities.
Amazed, he asked, anxious to know by what quality
this woman had tamed his brother&mdash;
</p><p>
"She was beautiful?"
</p><p>
"It is clear you never saw her."
</p><p>
"No. Was she ugly?"
</p><p>
"Yes, very ugly. She was short, brown, thin, and
had bad teeth, which I can't bear in women. Nevertheless,
being aware of this defect, she never laughed.
People used to say she deceived me, that in disguise
she used to go to the circus, as Messalina did, on visits
to a young and handsome groom. Well, what of it?
Did not I on my side deceive her? She never bothered
me, and I used to take care in return never to worry
her about these trifles. Folk used to say she was
cruel! By God, Julian, she knew how to govern! Of
course she didn't like the authors of epigrams on her
bad manners, comparing her to some kitchen-slave
dressed as Cæsar's wife! She loved revenge, admiration!
And what a mind, what a mind, Julian! Why,
I was as much at ease sheltered behind her, as behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
a granite wall. Ah, the mad things we used to do together!
We certainly never lacked amusement."
</p><p>
He smiled at some agreeable recollection and passed
the tip of his tongue along his rosy upper lip between
the sips of Chian wine.
</p><p>
"There's no denying we made the most of time,"
he repeated, not without modest pride.
</p><p>
When Julian was on his way to this interview with
his brother, he had thought of waking in him some
feeling of seriousness and remorse, had even prepared
a little speech, in the style of Libanius, against the
doings of irresponsible tyrants. He had expected to
see a man bowed under the yoke of Nemesis, and not
the tranquil fat and rosy visage of this comely athlete.
Words died on Julian's lips. He looked without blame
or distaste upon this "docile animal"&mdash;for so he inwardly
named his brother. Of what avail were sermons
to a young stallion? Julian contented himself
therefore with saying to Gallus in a grave tone&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why are you going to Milan? Do you suspect
nothing?"
</p><p>
"Yes&mdash;hush&mdash;but it is too late!"
</p><p>
And, sweeping his hand significantly round his neck,
he added&mdash;
</p><p>
"The slipnoose of death is already here! 'He' is
tightening it little by little. Why, he would unearth
me from a rabbit-burrow, Julian! No, no, best speak
no more of it! All's over! We've made the most
of time, that's all."
</p><p>
"But you have two legions left you at Antioch?"
</p><p>
"Not one. 'He' has filched all my best soldiers,
little by little, under colour of this pretext and that;
and always, by Jove! for my own good! Why, everything
he does is for my own good.... He thinks of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
nothing else! Now he's in a hurry to see me simply
to profit by my advice. Julian, that man is terrible!
You don't know yet, and God grant that you may
never know, what that man is. He sees everything,
knows my inmost thoughts, those that I wouldn't
mutter to my pillow; and he's watching your mind
also. Frankly, I am afraid of him!"
</p><p>
"But can't you escape?"
</p><p>
"Hush, speak lower!"
</p><p>
The features of Gallus took on an expression of boyish
terror.
</p><p>
"No, no; I tell you all is over! I am as neatly
finished as a fish already hooked. 'He' is drawing in
the line gently, so that it doesn't break. A Cæsar,
let him be who he will, is always a big fish to land. I
know that it's impossible to escape. He'll take me
one day or another.... And now I see the snare,
and I am walking into it all the same out of fear. For
six years, from the very first, I quaked before that
man. Like a small boy, now however I've walked
far enough. Brother, he'll cut my throat as a cook
cuts the throat of a fowl. But he will torture me first
by a thousand stratagems and caresses. I should prefer
to finish quicker."
</p><p>
The eyes of Gallus became suddenly brilliant, and he
exclaimed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah, if <i>she</i> had been here, at my side, she would
certainly have saved me! She was such an astonishing
woman!"
</p><p>
The tribune Scuda, entering the <i>triclinium</i> where
supper was laid, announced, with a profound salutation,
that on the morrow, in honour of the arrival of
Cæsar, there would be races in the hippodrome of Constantinople,
and that the celebrated rider Korax would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
take part in them. Gallus was delighted at the news,
and ordered a crown of bay-leaf to be prepared, that,
in case of the victory of Korax, he might himself crown
his favourite before the people. He launched into
racing stories, boasting the skill of his charioteers.
</p><p>
Gallus drank deeply, laughed like a man whose
rakish conscience is at ease, with not a trace of his recent
fears upon those handsome features. Only at the
last moment of farewell he kissed Julian heartily, suddenly
melting into tears.
</p><p>
"May God help you! May God help you!" he
blubbered. "You alone have stood my friend&mdash;you
and Constantia!"
</p><p>
Then he whispered into Julian's ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"I hope that you'll save your skin, brother. You
can wear a mask and keep your own counsel; I have
always envied you that. May God succour you!"
</p><p>
Julian sincerely pitied his brother; he knew that he
would not escape Constantius.
</p><p>
On the following morning Gallus left Constantinople
with his former escort. At Adrianople he was only
permitted to retain ten small chariots, and had to relinquish
all his personal suite and baggage. The
autumn was far advanced, the roads in fearful condition,
rain falling continuously all day for a week.
Peremptory messages reached Gallus to hurry on. He
was given no time to rest or sleep, and had taken no
bath for a fortnight.
</p><p>
One of his keenest discomforts was horror at close
contact with dirt. All his life he had taken peculiar
care to keep his body healthy and exquisitely groomed.
It was with profound melancholy that he gazed at his
uncut nails, and the purple of his travelling chlamys,
befouled by dust and muddy roads. Scuda never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
quitted his side for an instant, and Gallus, not without
reason, dreaded his assiduous companion. The tribune,
years ago, had come as bearer of a despatch from the
Emperor, and was but newly arrived in Antioch, when
by an impudent remark he had offended Constantia,
the wife of Gallus, who straightway in a fit of fury
had ordered the Roman tribune to be flogged and afterwards
thrown, like a slave, into a dungeon.
</p><p>
Foreseeing the probable consequence, Constantia
had quickly ordered the tribune to be set at liberty.
He then presented himself at the palace of Gallus, as
if nothing had occurred, and, pocketing the affront,
had never even reported it to his master; perhaps
through fear that so degrading a punishment might
besmirch the prospects of his career as a courtier.
</p><p>
During the whole journey from Antioch to Milan
Scuda retained his seat in Cæsar's chariot, never quitting
him, inviting his confidences, and treating him
like some wayward child, who, being out of sorts, was
not to be left to himself for a moment by a servant so
devoted and affectionate.
</p><p>
Where, as in Illyria, there were dangerous river
crossings to be made on frail wooden bridges, Scuda
would put his arm around Gallus with the tenderest
solicitude, and if the latter strove to free himself, swear
that he preferred death to the risk of drowning his
precious charge.
</p><p>
The tribune wore an oddly thoughtful expression,
especially when contemplating the neck of Gallus,
smooth and white as a young girl's. The Cæsar, feeling
this attentive look, would fidget uneasily in his
seat, and with difficulty restrain himself from striking
the amiable tribune in the face. But the poor prisoner's
spirits quickly rose again. He contented himself with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
imploring (for despite everything his appetite remained
healthy), that they might halt for a meal, were it never
so scanty. At Petovio, in Norica, they were met by
two fresh envoys from the Emperor, accompanied by a
cohort of Court legionaries.
</p><p>
The mask was then dropped. Round the palace
where Gallus slept armed sentinels were placed as
round a prison. In the evening the prefect Barbatio,
making his way in, without any pretence at ceremony,
ordered him to take off the chlamys of a Cæsar and
don the simple tunic and paludamentum, or ordinary
cloak, of a common soldier.
</p><p>
On the following morning the prisoner was ordered
to get into a karpenta, a little two-wheeled cart without
a hood employed by minor officials on official journeys.
A cold wind was blowing intermittently.
Scuda according to his custom put one arm round
Gallus, and with the disengaged hand gently fingered
the new garment.
</p><p>
"Sound cloak, this&mdash;soft and warm! Better than
the purple, which is a chilly affair! Why, they've
lined this tunic with double wool!" And pushing his
investigations further, Scuda slid a hand under the
paludamentum, then under the tunic, and suddenly,
with a laugh, drew forth the blade of a poniard, which
Gallus had succeeded in concealing.
</p><p>
"Now that's a mistake!" said Scuda. "Why,
you might through carelessness stab yourself! What
a boy you are!"
</p><p>
And he threw the dagger out on the road. An infinite
weariness seized Gallus. He closed his eyes and
felt the endearing grip of Scuda inside his arm. Was
it all a nightmare?
</p><p>
They halted at the fortress of Pola in Istria, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
shores of the Adriatic. Some years formerly this town
had been the scene of the murder of Priscus, the heroic
young son of Constantine the Great.
</p><p>
The gloomy town was thronged with soldiers. Interminable
barracks in the style of Diocletian had replaced
the houses of civilians. Snow lay thickly on
the roofs, the wind was moaning in deserted streets,
and the sea lay rumbling below.
</p><p>
Gallus was led into one of these barracks and given a
seat fronting the window, so that the full daylight fell
upon his face. One of the Emperor's most skilful
police officers&mdash;Eustaphius,&mdash;a little wrinkled and
amiable old man with the wheedling and penetrating
voice of a confessor, rubbed his blue and chilly hands
and began the cross-examination. Gallus, who was
mortally fatigued, said everything that Eustaphius
suggested he should say, but at the words "treason to
the empire," paled, and started to his feet.
</p><p>
"It was no doing of mine&mdash;nothing to do with
me!" he stammered in dismay. "Constantia planned
it all! It was she who exacted the death of Theophilus,
of Clement, Domitian, and the rest! Before God, it
was not I. She said nothing to me about it. I was
utterly ignorant!"
</p><p>
Eustaphius looked at him smilingly.
</p><p>
"Very well," he said, "I will duly inform the Emperor
that his own sister Constantia, spouse of the late
Cæsar of the East, alone is culpable."
</p><p>
And turning towards the legionaries he ordered&mdash;
</p><p>
"The interrogatory is finished. Take him away."
</p><p>
Shortly afterwards arrived the sentence of death decreed
by the Emperor Constantius, who had looked on
the accusation brought against his lamented sister in
the light of a personal insult.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
</p><p>
On hearing the sentence read out, Gallus lost consciousness
and fell into the arms of the soldiers. Up to
the last moment the poor fellow had hoped against
hope. And, even now, he expected that they would at
least grant him the reprieve of a few days, or hours, in
which to prepare for death. But a rumour had gone
round that the soldiers of the "Steadfast Sixteenth
Flavian" legion were insubordinate, and planning to
free Gallus; so he was dragged off incontinently to
execution.
</p><p>
It was the early dawn. The snow, fallen during
the night, had covered the foul mud, and lay glittering
in chilly sunshine, its dazzling reflection lighting up
the ceiling of the small room whither Gallus had been
conducted.
</p><p>
The authorities distrusted the soldiery, who almost
all liked and pitied the disgraced Cæsar; so for executioner
they had chosen a butcher, who sometimes officiated
in disposing of the thieves and brigands of the
neighbourhood. This barbarian, unused to a Roman
sword, had brought to the block a great double-edged
axe which served him in the slaughter-yard. The
butcher was a stupid, handsome, and sleepy slave.
The name of the condemned man had been concealed
from him and he believed he was only to behead a common
thief. Before the last scene, Gallus became calm
and humble, allowing his gaolers to do what they
listed. Like a child, he wept and struggled when
about to be placed by force in a bath, but once in he
found the water pleasant.
</p><p>
But at sight of the butcher sharpening his axe he
shivered in all his limbs. A barber then carefully
shaved off the fine golden hair, always the beauty and
pride of the young Cæsar. In returning from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
barber's room Gallus, finding himself alone for a moment
with the tribune Scuda, unexpectedly dropped
on his knees before the cruellest of his foes.
</p><p>
"Save me, Scuda! I know you can do it! Tonight
I have received a message from the Flavian
legion. Let me get a word with them. They will
deliver me! I have thirty talents hidden in the temple
at Mycenæ. Nobody knows it. I'll give them to
you,&mdash;and more, much more! The soldiers love me.
I'll make you my friend, my brother, my co-regent
... fellow-Cæsar!"
</p><p>
Mad with hope, he embraced the tribune's knees,
and Scuda, shuddering, felt the lips of the Cæsar on
his hands. He made no answer, and, smiling, slowly
freed himself from the embrace. Gallus was ordered
to undress. He objected to take off his sandals, his
feet being unclean. When he was almost naked the
butcher began to bind his hands behind his back, thief-fashion,
and Scuda hastened to help him. When Gallus
felt the touch of the tribune's fingers, in a fit of fury
he escaped from the grasp of the headsman, seized
Scuda by the throat, and endeavoured to strangle him.
In his naked activity he seemed suddenly transformed
into some sinewy and terrible young tiger.
</p><p>
The choking tribune was snatched from the grapple,
and the prisoner's feet and hands were securely bound.
At this moment in the barrack court resounded the
shouts of the Flavian soldiers&mdash;"Long live Cæsar
Gallus!" and the murderers hurried on with their job.
A great section of a tree-trunk was rolled in for a
block, and Gallus thrust down on his knees in front
of it. Barbatio, Baïnobadois, and Apodemus gripped
him by the shoulders, hands, and feet; and Scuda
bowed the head against the block, weighing down that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
vainly resisting skull with all his might. Chilled by
emotion, his fingers felt the newly-shorn pate still moist
with soap. The butcher proved an unskilful headsman.
His axe slashed the neck, but the blow fell
awry. He raised the hatchet a second time, crying to
Scuda&mdash;
</p><p>
"More to the right! Hold the head more to the
right!"
</p><p>
Gallus struggled and roared like a half-stunned bull.
Nearer and nearer the cries of the soldiery resounded:
</p><p>
"Long live Gallus Cæsar!"
</p><p>
The butcher heaved his handle high and smote. A
stream of blood gushed over the hands of Scuda; the
head fell with a thud, and rolled away over the stone
flags.
</p><p>
At that moment the legionaries burst into the hall.
Barbatio, Apodemus, and Scuda hurried to the opposite
door, the headsman remaining at a loss; but Scuda
muttered in his ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"Take Cæsar's head, so that the legionaries may not
recognise the body. It's a question of life or death
for us all!"
</p><p>
"He was <i>not</i> a thief then?" faltered the executioner,
in amazement.
</p><p>
He found it difficult to carry this shaven head; at
first he slid it under an arm, but it became uncomfortable;
then, slipping his hooked thumb into the mouth,
he managed to bear off the skull of him before whom
so many heads had once bowed down.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Julian, on learning the death of his brother, said
quietly to himself&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now comes my turn!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XII</h2>

<p>It was at Athens that Julian was about to take his
vows and finally become a monk. One fresh spring
morning, before the sun was up, Julian, issuing from
the church where he had officiated at matins, followed
for a few miles the banks of the Ilissus, in the shadow
of plane-trees and wild vine. Not far from Athens he
had lighted upon a solitary place, on the edge of a torrent
which poured, like a scarf of silver, upon a sandy
bottom. Thence he used often to gaze with wonder
through the mists at the ruddy cliff of the Acropolis
and the haughty lines of the Parthenon, half-illumined
by the dawn.
</p><p>
On this particular morning Julian took off his shoes
and walked along the reaches of the Ilissus barefoot.
The air was full of the smell of flowers and of the rich-scented
muscat grape&mdash;that aroma in which there is a
foretaste of wine, faint as the promise of first love,
stealing into the soul of youth.
</p><p>
Julian, with feet in the water, sat down upon a
platan-root, opened the <i>Phædrus</i> and began to read at
the passage in the dialogue in which Socrates says to
Phædrus: "Let us go this way, and follow the course
of the Ilissus; we will choose a solitary place and there
sit down.
</p><p>
"<i>Phædrus</i>: Luckily, I'm unshod this morning, and
as for you, Socrates, you always go barefoot. We'll
walk in the bed of the river. Look, how smiling and
pellucid the water is!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
</p><p>
"<i>Socrates</i>: By Pallas! here's a wonderful nook; it
must be sacred to the nymphs and to the god Acheloüs&mdash;to
judge by these little statues. Doesn't it seem to
you as if here the breeze were softer and of sweeter
odour? Here, even in the hum of the crickets there's
something of the sweetness of summer. But what I
love best of all is this deep grass!"
</p><p>
Julian turned from the book with a smile. All was
as it had been eight centuries before. Even the
crickets set up their song.
</p><p>
"Socrates actually touched this ground with his
feet!" he thought, and burying his head among the
reeds he kissed the spot with adoration.
</p><p>
"Good-day, Julian! you've chosen a lovely corner
there to read in. May I sit down near you?"
</p><p>
"Sit, sit; I shall be delighted. Poets never violate
a solitude."
</p><p>
Julian looked up at a meagre personage, draped in
an enormously long cloak (it was the poet Publius
Porphyrius), thinking to himself&mdash;
</p><p>
"He's so small and frail that I believe he'll soon
turn into a grasshopper, as Plato fancied the poets
do."
</p><p>
Publius, like the grasshoppers, could almost live
upon air, but the gods had not granted him complete
immunity from appetite; and his shaven cadaverous
face and discoloured lips were stamped with insatiable
hunger.
</p><p>
"Why are you wearing such a long cloak, Publius?"
Julian asked.
</p><p>
"It isn't mine," answered the other philosophically.
"I share a room with a young man, Hephæstion, who
has come to Athens to learn eloquence. He will be a
famous lawyer one day. Meanwhile he's as poor as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
I am, poor as a lyric poet&mdash;I need say no more! Why,
we've pledged our clothes, our furniture, even the
inkstand; but we still have a cloak between us. In
the morning I go out, and Hephæstion studies Demosthenes;
in the evening he puts on the chlamys,
and I write verses. Unfortunately we're not the same
height&mdash;but what does that matter? I take my walks
along the streets 'long-robed,' like the ancient Trojan
ladies."
</p><p>
Publius laughed heartily; the cadaverous face took
on the expression of a mourner who has incautiously
cheered up.
</p><p>
"You see, Julian," continued the poet, "I'm counting
on the death of the widow of a very rich Roman
landowner. The happy heirs will order an epitaph
from me, and are going to pay for it generously. Unfortunately
the widow, in spite of everything that
doctors and heirs can do, persists in not giving up the
ghost. But for that, my boy, I should have bought
myself a cloak long ago. Listen, Julian, get up and
come with me at once!"
</p><p>
"Whither?"
</p><p>
"Trust me&mdash;you'll thank me for it."
</p><p>
"What's the mystery?"
</p><p>
"Ask no questions; get up and come! The poet
brings no harm to the poet's friend. You'll see a
goddess."
</p><p>
"What goddess?"
</p><p>
"Artemis, the huntress."
</p><p>
"A picture? Statue?"
</p><p>
"Much better than that. If you love beauty, take
your cloak and follow me."
</p><p>
Publius assumed so seductive and mysterious an air
that Julian was bitten by curiosity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
</p><p>
"There's but one condition. Say nothing, and
marvel at nothing we do. Otherwise the spell will
break. In the name of Calliope and Erato, just trust
me! We're only two yards from the place, and to
shorten the road for you I'll read you the beginning
of my epitaph on the widow."
</p><p>
They issued on the dusty high-road. Under the first
rays of the sun the steel shield of Pallas Athene darted
lightnings from the rose-hued Acropolis. Along the
stone walls, hiding brooks humming along under the
fig-trees, the grasshoppers were singing shrilly, vieing
with the hoarse voice of the poet as he recited the
epitaph.
</p><p>
Publius Porphyrius was a man not destitute of
talent. His career had been a curious one. Several
years previously he had possessed a pretty little house,
a veritable temple of Hermes, at Constantinople, not
far from the Chalcedonian suburb. His father, an oil
merchant, had bequeathed him a little fortune which
should have permitted him to live without cares. But
Publius was a worshipper of antique Hellenism, and
rebelled against what he called the triumph of Christian
servitude. He wrote a liberal poem which displeased
the Emperor Constantius, who was therein alluded to
unfavourably. This allusion cost the author dear.
Chastisement fell upon him; his house and goods were
confiscated, and he himself banished to an islet in the
archipelago, inhabited only by rocks, goats, and fevers.
This trial was more than Publius could stand. He
cursed liberal opinions, and determined to blot out his
misdeeds at any price. Shaking with fever, he composed
during his sleepless nights, by means of sentences
culled from Virgil, a poem glorifying the Emperor;
the verses of the ancient poet being grouped in such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
fashion that they formed a new work. This ingenious
puzzle tickled the palate of the Court. Publius had
divined the taste of the century.
</p><p>
Straightway he ventured on feats more astonishing
still. He wrote a dithyrambic, or Bacchic ode in free
stanzas, and addressed it to Constantius. It consisted
of verses of different lengths, designed so that they
formed complete figures, such as a Pan's flute, a water-organ,
or a sacrificial altar on which the smoke was
represented by uneven phrases. But by a marvel of
skilfulness the poem was so contrived as to make a
decorative oblong twenty hexameters wide and forty
hexameters long. Certain lines were traced in red ink
and, read together, became transformed into a monogram
of Christ, or into a flower of arabesques, but
always, in whatever shape, made new lines composed
of new compliments. Finally the four last hexameters
of the book could be read in eighteen different orders:
from the end backwards, from the beginning, from the
side, from the middle, from above, from below, etc.,
and, read in what manner you please, formed a eulogy
to the Emperor.
</p><p>
In executing this work the poor poet nearly lost his
wits. But his victory was complete, and Constantius
more than charmed. He believed that Publius had
surpassed all the poets of antiquity; he wrote the
author a letter with his own hand, assuring him of protection
and ending thus: "In our age My bounty, like
the calm breath of the zephyrs, is breathed upon all
who write verses."
</p><p>
Nevertheless his confiscated property was not restored
to the poet; he was simply given money and
authorised to quit his desert island for Athens.
</p><p>
There he led a melancholy existence. The ostler in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the stables of the circus, in comparison with Publius,
lived in luxury.
</p><p>
In the company of gravediggers, shady speculators,
furnishers of nuptial feasts, he passed whole days in
the antechambers of the illiterate great, in order to
obtain orders for a marriage ode, an epitaph, or a love-letter.
At this trade he gained little, but never lost
heart, hoping to offer to the Emperor one day a poem
which would win him complete pardon.
</p><p>
Julian felt that in spite of this outward abasement
Porphyrius bore at heart a deep love for Hellas. He
was a fine critic of Greek poetry and Julian enjoyed
his conversation.
</p><p>
They left the high-road and approached the high wall
of an enclosure like some <i>palæstra</i> or exercise-ground.
Round about all was solitary; two black lambs were
cropping the grass; near the closed door, in the chinks
of which poppies and white daisies were growing, there
stood a chariot and two white horses. Their manes
were close-cut like those of the horses in the bas-reliefs.
By them stood an old slave, a deaf-mute, but evidently
of an affable disposition, for he immediately recognised
Publius and nodded to him in friendly fashion, pointing
to the closed gate of the wrestling ground.
</p><p>
"Lend me your purse a moment," said Publius to
Julian. "I'll take out one or two pence for this poor
old fool."
</p><p>
He threw the coins, and the mute, with servile
grimaces and pleased grunts, opened the door.
</p><p>
They entered under a long and dark covered gallery.
Between rows of columns ran other galleries laid out
for the exercise of athletes. The spaces in their midst
were now widths of grass instead of sand. The two
friends penetrated a large inner portico. Julian's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
curiosity became keener at every step, the mysterious
Publius leading him on by the hand without a word.
Doors of <i>exedræ</i>, or academic halls where orators used
to meet, opened into the second portico, and the grasshoppers
were humming now where eloquent discourses
of Athenian sages had in old time resounded. Above
the deep grass bees were whirling: silence and melancholy
pervaded all. Suddenly, a woman's voice was
heard, and the noise of a disk striking the marble,
followed by a merry burst of laughter.
</p><p>
Stealing in like robbers, the pair hid themselves in
the outer shadow of the columns of the <i>elaiothesion</i>, or
place where the ancient wrestlers used to rub themselves
over with oil.
</p><p>
From behind these columns could be seen the <i>ephebeion</i>,
a quadrangular space open to the sky, originally
laid out for disk-throwing, and now newly strown with
fresh sand.
</p><p>
Julian looked in, and started back.
</p><p>
At twenty paces from him stood a young girl entirely
naked. His eyes swept over her wonderful
body. She was holding a discus in her hand.
</p><p>
Julian longed instinctively to beat a retreat; but
turning, he saw in the eyes of Publius and upon the
whole of that lean tawny face such a look of admiration,
that he understood that the adorer of Hellas, in
bringing him to the place, had been moved by no
shameful thought; that enthusiasm was wholly sacred.
</p><p>
Publius, seizing the hand of Julian, murmured:
</p><p>
"Look! We are now nine centuries back, in ancient
Laconia. Do you remember the verses of Propertius&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Multa tuæ, Sparte, miramur jura palæstræ,<br />
Sed mage virginei, tot bona gymnasii,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Quod non infames exercet corpore ludos<br />
Inter luctantes nuda puella viros?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Who is she?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"I don't know. I never wanted to know."
</p><p>
"That is well! Hush!"
</p><p>
Now he gazed eagerly and without shame at the
girl hurling the disk. Blushes were unworthy of a
philosopher.
</p><p>
She retreated some steps, inclined her body forward,
and advancing the left leg made a swift bounding
movement, and shot the metal circle so high that it
shone in the rising sun, and in falling struck the farthest
pillar. It was like watching the motions of a statue
by Phidias.
</p><p>
"That shot was the best," said a little twelve-year-old
damsel, clad in a rich tunic and standing near the
column.
</p><p>
"Myrrha, give me the disk," replied the player.
"I can throw it higher than that, as you shall see.
Meroë, get farther out of the way. I might hurt you,
as Apollo hurt Hyacinthus."
</p><p>
Meroë, an old Egyptian, to judge by her multi-coloured
vestments and tanned visage, was preparing
in alabaster jars perfumes for a bath. Julian understood
that the mute slave of the gate and the white-horsed
chariot outside must belong to these two votaries
of the Laconian games.
</p><p>
After the disk-throwing the young girl took from
Myrrha a bow and a quiver, and drew thence a long
arrow. She aimed at a black circle at the opposite end
of the <i>ephebeion</i>; the string hummed, the arrow flew
whistling and stuck in the target: then a second, then
a third.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
</p><p>
"O huntress Artemis!" sighed Publius.
</p><p>
Suddenly a sunbeam slipping between two columns
shot into the face and youthful breast of the young girl.
Throwing bow and arrows aside in sudden bedazzlement,
she hid her face in her hands.
</p><p>
Swallows, uttering their faint fine chirpings, undulated
about the exercise-ground, and pursuing each
other vanished into the blue of the sky.
</p><p>
She uncovered her face and raised her arms above
her head.
</p><p>
Its fair hair, golden at its ends as honey in the sun,
at its roots was auburn; her lips half opened in a
happy smile, she suffered the sun to bathe her body,
gliding lower and lower yet, till she stood clothed, as
in the loveliest raiment, in pure light and beauty.
</p><p>
"Myrrha," the girl murmured slowly and dreamily,
"look at the sky! How beautiful it would be to bathe
in it, like those birds! Do you remember our saying
that men could not be happy because they had no
wings? When I look at the birds I am consumed with
envy. One should be light and bare as I am at this
moment, and winging high up in the sky, and knowing
that one could fly forever&mdash;that there should be nothing
else but sky and sun about one's light and free and
naked body!"
</p><p>
Drawing herself up to her full height with out-stretched
arms she sighed deeply, as at some remembered
joy fled away for ever.
</p><p>
The burning caress of the sun now reached her
waist. Suddenly she shivered and grew ashamed, as
if some living and passionate being had approached
her. With one hand she shielded her breast, with the
other the abdomen, the immortal gesture of Aphrodite
of Cnidos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
</p><p>
"Meroë, give me my clothes! quick, Meroë!" she
exclaimed, with eyes wide open and startled.
</p><p>
Julian never remembered how he came forth from
the wrestling-ground; his heart was on fire. The
poet's face was solemn as that of a man quitting a
temple.
</p><p>
"You are not annoyed?" he asked Julian.
</p><p>
"No; why should I be?"
</p><p>
"Perhaps a Christian might find it a temptation?"
</p><p>
"There was nothing of temptation there for me. Do
you understand?"
</p><p>
"Perfectly; that is what I thought."
</p><p>
And again they found themselves on the dusty high road,
where the sun was already hot, and bent their
steps towards Athens.
</p><p>
Publius continued in an undertone, as it were talking
to himself&mdash;
</p><p>
"Oh, how shameful, how deformed we are nowadays!
Ashamed of our own morose and pitiful nakedness, we
hide it because we feel ugly and impure. Whereas
of old time.... Ah! there was a time when all was
very different. Julian, the young girls of Sparta used
to go out upon the wrestling-ground naked and
haughty before all the people. Nobody feared temptation
in those days. Folk were simple as children&mdash;as
gods! And to think that nevermore shall that happen
again; that the freedom, the cleanness, of that happy
state shall be seen on earth no more!"
</p><p>
The poet's chin fell on his breast, and he sighed
drearily.
</p><p>
They came at last to the Street of Tripods, and hard
by the Acropolis the friends separated and went their
ways in silence.
</p><p>
Julian went into the shadow of the propylæa,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
through vast porches leading into temple-enclosures;
but avoided the Decorated Porch, on which Parrhasius
had chiselled the battles of Marathon and Salamis, and
passing the little temple of the Wingless Victory ascended
to the Parthenon.
</p><p>
He had but to shut his eyes to remember the superb
body of Artemis the huntress. When he opened them
the sun-bathed Parthenon marbles seemed golden and
living as that divine body; and, despising Imperial
spies and chances of death, he desired openly to worship
and kiss the warm stones of that holy place.
</p><p>
Two black-robed young men of pale and severe
countenance were standing near. They were Gregory
of Nazianzen and Basil of Cæsarea. The Hellenists
feared these two men as their most formidable foes. It
was the hope of the Christians that the two friends
would one day become fathers of the Church. They
were now watching Julian.
</p><p>
"What's the matter with him to-day?" said Gregory.
"Is that the attitude of a monk? Are those the
gestures of a monk? Do you see those closed eyes&mdash;that
smile? Do you believe that his piety is genuine,
Basil?"
</p><p>
"I have often watched him weeping and praying in
church."
</p><p>
"Mere hypocrisy!"
</p><p>
"If so, why does he come to us, seek our friendship,
and argue over the Scriptures?"
</p><p>
"He's deceiving himself; or perhaps he wishes to
seduce the faithful. Never trust him! He is the
tempter! Remember what I say, brother, the Roman
Empire in fostering this young man is nursing an
adder!"
</p><p>
The two friends went off, their eyes on the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
The severe caryatids of the Erechtheum, the laughing
blue of the sky, the white temple of the Wingless One,
the Porches and the Parthenon, that wonder of the
world, on them cast no spell. One thing alone did
they desire: to lay all these haunts of demons in the
dust. The long shadows of the monks fell on the
Parthenon steps as they walked away.
</p><p>
"I must see her again," Julian was thinking; "I
must find out who she is."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIII</h2>

<p>"The gods created mortals for one purpose only&mdash;polite
conversation!"
</p><p>
"Charmingly said, Mamertinus! Say it again, I
beg, before you've forgotten it! I'll write that down
with the other maxims," declared Lampridius, the
professor of eloquence, taking tablets from his pocket.
His admired friend Mamertinus was a fashionable
Athenian advocate.
</p><p>
"My dear fellow, I say," repeated Mamertinus with
the most delicate of smiles, "I merely say that men
have been sent by the gods&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"No, no, it didn't run so, Mamertinus; you put it
better. The gods created mortals&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Ah, yes; the gods created mortals for one purpose
only&mdash;polite conversation!"
</p><p>
And the enthusiastic Lampridius scribbled down the
words as if they had been the utterance of an oracle.
</p><p>
The scene was a friendly supper of men of letters
given by the venerable Roman senator Hortensius, in
the villa of his rich young ward Arsinoë, not far from
the Piræus.
</p><p>
Mamertinus on that day had achieved a remarkable
speech in defence of the banker Barnava. Nobody had
the smallest doubt that Barnava was a complete scoundrel;
but, besides measureless eloquence, the advocate
possessed so telling a voice that one of the innumerable
ladies who adored him avowed: "I never listen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
what Mamertinus says; I have no wish to know what
he's talking about. I become intoxicated with the
tones of his voice, and especially with the dying
cadence at the end of his periods. It is incredible!
It is no longer a human voice, but nectar and ambrosia,
the heavenly sighing of an Æolian harp!"
</p><p>
And so, while the populace labelled the money-lender
Barnava "the blood-sucker," the devourer of
widows and orphans, the Athenian judges enthusiastically
acquitted the client of Mamertinus.
</p><p>
From this client the advocate had received 50,000
sesterces, and therefore felt in no dissatisfied mood at
the supper given by Hortensius in his honour. But it
was his habit to affect the invalid, in order that he
might be spoiled and petted the more.
</p><p>
"I am utterly done up to-day, my friends," he murmured
plaintively; "aching in every limb. Where is
Arsinoë?"
</p><p>
"She will soon be here. Arsinoë has just received
from the museum of Alexandria some new apparatus
for experiments in physics; and she is entirely absorbed
in them. But I will give an order to summon her,"
suggested Hortensius.
</p><p>
"No, don't do that," responded the lawyer carelessly.
"But what a ridiculous thing&mdash;a young girl at
physics! What in the world has the one thing to do
with the other? Your blue-stockings have been finely
belaboured by Aristophanes and Euripides. Arsinoë
is a whimsical creature, Hortensius! Really, if she
wasn't so attractive, what with her sculpture and her
mathematics she would almost become&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
He did not finish the sentence, and gazed languidly
out of the window.
</p><p>
"What am I to do?" replied Hortensius. "A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
spoiled child ... an orphan; no father, no mother!
As her mere tutor, I can't well deny her anything."
</p><p>
"I see, I see."
</p><p>
The lawyer was no longer listening; he was thinking
about himself.
</p><p>
"My dear fellows, I feel&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"What&mdash;what's the matter?" asked several voices
anxiously.
</p><p>
"I'm feeling&mdash;I fancy&mdash;a draught...."
</p><p>
"We'll shut the shutters," proposed the host.
</p><p>
"No, we should be stifled! But I've so worn out
my voice to-day.... And I have to make another
defence to-morrow. Give me a carpet under my feet,
and my wrapper; I'm afraid of catching cold in the
night chill."
</p><p>
And Hephæstion, the friend of Publius and pupil of
Lampridius, rushed away to get Mamertinus' wrapper.
</p><p>
It was a piece of soft woollen stuff, daintily embroidered.
The lawyer carried it everywhere to safeguard
his precious throat from the faintest risk of cold.
</p><p>
Mamertinus nursed his own health like a lover, with
so simple a grace, such a passion of self-solicitude, that
his friends were instinctively constrained to think of
nothing but nursing him too.
</p><p>
"This wrapper was embroidered for me by the venerable
Fabiola," he informed them with a smile.
</p><p>
"Wife of the senator?" asked Hortensius.
</p><p>
"Yes! I'll tell you a little story about her. One
day I wrote a note&mdash;a graceful trifle, but really a mere
trifle&mdash;just five lines in Greek to another lady (also one
of my admirers), who had sent me a basket of the most
charming cherries. I thanked her in a frolicsome
imitation of Pliny. But just imagine, my friends,
Fabiola was seized with so violent a desire to read that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
letter and to copy it for her collection, that she sent
two of her slaves to lie in wait for my messenger.
So, brought to a halt in the middle of the night, not a
soul in sight, he thought, of course, that brigands were
about to strip him of lock, stock, and barrel. But
they did him no harm, gave him money, and only took
from him my letter, so that Fabiola might have the
first reading of it. She actually learnt it by heart!"
</p><p>
"You don't mean it? Ah, I know her! She is a
most remarkable woman," continued Lampridius.
"I have seen myself that she keeps all your letters
enclosed in a lemon-wood casket like so many jewels.
She learns them by heart and declares that they are
superior to any poetry. Fabiola argues, and argues
rightly: 'Since Alexander the Great used to keep the
poems of Homer in a cedar-wood coffer, why shouldn't
I keep the letters of Mamertinus in a jewel-casket?'"
</p><p>
"This <i>foie gras</i> with saffron sauce is the height of
perfection! I advise you to taste it."
</p><p>
"Who made it, Hortensius?"
</p><p>
"My head-cook, Dædalus."
</p><p>
"All honour to him!... he's a poet."
</p><p>
"Don't let a goose's liver run away with you, my
dear Garguillus! A cook, a poet? You will offend
the divine muses, our protectresses!"
</p><p>
"I affirm! and I shall always maintain! that cooking
is an art as lofty as any other. It's time to fling
prejudices to the winds, Lampridius!"
</p><p>
Garguillus, the head of the Imperial chancery, was
a man of enormous body, extremely fat, his triple chin
scrupulously shaved and perfumed, and his grey hair
closely cropped. His face was intelligent and noble;
for many years he had been considered the indispensable
guest at every supper of Athenian men of letters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Garguillus loved only two things in the world, a good
table and a good style. Gastronomy and literature
blended for him into a double bliss.
</p><p>
"Suppose now I take an oyster," he was declaring
while his delicate fingers, loaded with amethysts and
rubies, brought the mollusc towards his mouth; "I
take an oyster, and I swallow it"&mdash;and in fact he
swallowed it, shutting his eyes, with a sucking and
clucking noise of his upper lip, which was curiously
greedy, and even rapacious, in its appearance. It was
prominent, trussed into a point, oddly twisted, and
vaguely resembled a small elephant's trunk. When
repeating a sonorous verse of Anacreon or Moschus he
would move about this upper lip with as much sensuousness
as when tasting at supper some sauce of nightingales'
tongues.
</p><p>
"I swallow it, and I am immediately aware," went
on Garguillus solemnly&mdash;"I am immediately aware
that the oyster comes from the coast of Britain and not
from the south or from Tarentum. Would you like
me to prove it? Shall I close my eyes and say from
what sea the fish comes?"
</p><p>
"But what in the world has that to do with poetry?"
asked Mamertinus impatiently. He could not bear
that any but himself should receive general attention.
</p><p>
"Imagine for yourselves, my dear friends," continued
the gastronomist imperturbably, "that for years
I have not been to the shores of the ocean, which I
love and am always regretting. I assure you that a
good oyster has such a fresh and salty relish of the sea,
that to swallow it is immediately to be a thousand miles
hence on the immense seashore. I close my eyes, I see
the waves, I see the rocks, I feel the breeze of 'foggy
ocean,' as Homer calls it!... No! tell me frankly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
what verse of the Odyssey can wake in me as clearly
the sense of sea poetry as the smell of a fresh oyster?
Or when I divide a peach and inhale the odour of its
juice, why, tell me, are the perfume of the violet and
the rose more essentially poetical? Poets describe
form, colour, sound. Why can taste be not perfect as
these? All is stupid prejudice, my dear fellows!
Taste is an immense and hitherto unexplored boon
from the gods. The assemblage of tastes forms a
harmony as fine as any orchestration of sounds. I
affirm, therefore, that there is a tenth muse, the muse
of Gastronomy!"
</p><p>
"Let oysters and peaches be admitted. But what
harmony, what beauty can you discover in a goose liver
dressed with saffron sauce?"
</p><p>
"You are ready to allow, Lampridius, that there is
beauty not only in the idylls of Theocritus, but even
in the coarsest comedies of Plautus?"
</p><p>
"I admit that."
</p><p>
"Well, my friend, for me there is a gastronomic
poesy in <i>foie gras</i>; in fact I am prepared to crown
Dædalus with laurels for this dish, just as I would
crown an Olympic ode of Pindar!"
</p><p>
Two new guests appeared on the threshold; they
were Julian and the poet Publius. Hortensius yielded
the place of honour to Julian, while Publius devoured
the innumerable dishes with his eyes. To judge by
his new chlamys the rich widow must have departed
this life, and the happy heirs paid for the epitaph in no
niggardly fashion.
</p><p>
The general conversation went on. Lampridius told
a story of how one day, moved by curiosity, he had
been to hear a Christian preacher thundering against
pagan grammarians. "The grammarians," assevered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
the preacher, "do not rank men for their worth, but
for their literary style, thinking it less criminal to kill
a man than to pronounce the word <i>homo</i> with a wrong
aspiration!" Lampridius suspected that if these
Christian preachers hated the style of the rhetoricians
to such a degree, it was because, conscious that they
themselves could write and speak only like barbarians,
they made ignorance the badge of moral worth,
so that for them a good speaker became a suspicious
character.
</p><p>
"The day on which eloquence perishes will see the
end of Hellas, the end of Rome! People will turn into
dumb animals, and it is to make them so that Christian
preachers use their barbarous jargon."
</p><p>
"Who knows," murmured Mamertinus pensively,
"perhaps style <i>is</i> more important than virtue, since
slaves, barbarians, and nincompoops can all be virtuous!"
</p><p>
Hephæstion meanwhile was explaining to his neighbour
the exact meaning of Cicero's advice&mdash;"<i>Causam
mendaciunculis adspergere</i>."
</p><p>
"<i>Mendaciunculis</i>, that's to say, little lies. Cicero,
in fact, advises you to sow little inventions all over
your speech; he admits falsehood if decorative."
</p><p>
Then followed a general discussion on the methods
of beginning a speech: should the beginning be anapæstic
or dactylic?
</p><p>
Julian became bored.
</p><p>
He confessed heartily that he had never considered
the matter, and that in his opinion the speaker ought
rather to preoccupy himself with the fundamental idea
of his speech than with the making style out of a
mosaic of peccadilloes.
</p><p>
Mamertinus&mdash;then Lampridius and Hephæstion&mdash;waxed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
wroth. According to them the subject of a
speech was a matter of no moment. To an orator it
should be absolutely indifferent whether he undertook
to attack or to defend a case. Even meaning had no
interest for him. The principal thing was the orchestration
of verbal sounds&mdash;the melody, the musical assonance
of letters&mdash;permitting even a barbarian, witless
of Greek, to feel the sheer beauty of language.
</p><p>
"I'll just give you an example, two Latin verses of
Propertius," said Garguillus. "Notice the power of
the sounds and the emptiness of the meaning. Listen&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'<i>Et Veneris dominæ volucres, mea turba columbæ,
Tingunt Gorgonio punica rostra lacu.</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What pure delight! Every letter sings! What
does the meaning matter? All the beauty consists in
the sound, in the assemblage of vowels and consonants.
For that utterance I would give all the civic virtue of
Juvenal and the philosophy of Lucretius! No! Just
hear again! What sweetness there is in that murmur&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'<i>Et Veneris dominæ volucres, mea turba columbæ!</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and he wagged that upper lip with a smack of delight.
</p><p>
Everybody repeated the lines of Propertius, unwearying
of their charm, and embarking on a veritable orgy
of quotation.
</p><p>
"Just listen," murmured Mamertinus in his Æolian
voice&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'<i>Tingunt Gorgonio...</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"<i>Tingunt Gorgonio</i>," repeated the master of chancery.
"By Pallas!&mdash;why, it delights one's very palate.
It's like swallowing a warm mouthful of wine mingled
with Attic honey&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"'<i>Tingunt Gorgonio...</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note how the 'g's' follow each other, and then
farther on&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"'<i> ...punica rostra lacu.</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Astounding! inimitable!" murmured Lampridius,
shutting his eyes.
</p><p>
Julian was ashamed and amused at this verbal intoxication.
</p><p>
"Words should be, to a certain extent, devoid of
meaning," continued Lampridius gravely; "they
should flow, roar, chant, without ever bringing up
short either the ear or the emotion. Then only real
enjoyment of their beauty is possible."
</p><p>
On the threshold of the door, from which the gaze
of Julian had seldom departed, there now appeared,
quietly as a shadow, a white and haughty figure.
</p><p>
The open shutters allowed the moonlight to fall in,
mingling with the ruddy shine of torches on the mosaic
of the mirror-smooth floor, and on the wall frescoes,
portraying Endymion asleep under the caresses of
Selene. The apparition kept still as a statue. The
antique Greek peplum of soft white wool fell in long
folds, cinctured high under the breast. Moonlight illumined
the robe, but the face remained in shadow. The
new-comer looked at Julian and Julian looked at her.
They smiled at each other, knowing that nobody observed
them, and finger on lip she listened to the anecdotes
of the guests.
</p><p>
Suddenly Mamertinus, who was discussing with
Lampridius grammatical peculiarities of the first and
second aorist, exclaimed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Arsinoë! At last! So you've made up your
mind to abandon physics and modelling for our company?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
</p><p>
She came in and deigned a smile to everyone.
</p><p>
She was the same disk-thrower whom a month before
Julian had seen in the abandoned wrestling-ground.
The poet Publius, knowing everybody and everything
in Athens, had sought the acquaintance of Hortensius
and Arsinoë, and had introduced Julian to the house.
</p><p>
Arsinoë's father, an old Roman senator, Helvidius
Priscus, had died during the last years of Constantine
the Great, bequeathing Arsinoë and Myrrha, his two
daughters by a Goth woman-prisoner, to Hortensius,
whom he respected on account of his love for antique
Rome and hatred for Christianity. A distant relative
of Arsinoë, owner of factories of purple at Sidon, had
left his incalculable wealth to the young girl.
</p><p>
To Arsinoë, Christian virtues and the patriarchal
customs of Rome seemed equally contemptible. The
figures of independent women, Aspasia, Cleopatra, and
Sappho, alone captivated her girlish imagination.
Had she not declared naïvely one day, to the horror
of Hortensius, that she would rather become a beautiful
and free courtesan, than be transformed into the
mother of a family, slave of a husband, "like everybody
else"? Those three words, "like everybody
else," filled her with melancholy disgust. At one
time Arsinoë was attracted by natural science, and
had worked with illustrious men of science at the
museum in Alexandria. Then the atomic theories of
Epicurus, Democrates, and Lucretius had enthralled
her. She loved a study which should deliver her soul
from the "terror of the gods."
</p><p>
With the same almost morbid intensity, she had
afterwards applied herself to sculpture, and had come
to Athens in order to study the best works, the masterpieces
of Phidias, Scopas, and Praxiteles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
</p><p>
"You are still discussing grammar?" asked the
daughter of Helvidius Priscus of the guests, as she
came into the dining-hall. She continued ironically:
"Don't trouble yourselves; go on. I won't argue or
complain, because I'm too hungry after my day's
work. Slave, some wine!..."
</p><p>
"My friends," continued Arsinoë when seated,
"you'll ruin your minds with quotations from Demosthenes
and your rules from Quintilian!... Take
care! Rhetoric will ruin you.... I want to see a
man who doesn't care a fig for Homer or for Cicero,
who speaks without thinking of the aspirates, of syntax,
or of the conjunction of letters. Julian, let us go
down to the beach after supper; I am disinclined for
discussions on dactyls and anapæsts."
</p><p>
"Precisely my own mood, Arsinoë," stammered
Garguillus, who had eaten too much <i>foie gras</i> and who
almost always, at the end of dinner, felt an aversion
for literature proportionate to the weight upon his
stomach.
</p><p>
"<i>Litterarum intemperantia laboramus</i>," as Seneca
used to say. "We are suffering from literary indigestion.
We are simply poisoning ourselves!" and he
thoughtfully took a tooth-pick from a pocket. His
large face expressed weariness and disgust.

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIV</h2>

<p>Together the pair went down the alley of cypresses
leading to the sea. The moon-path of
sensitive silver on the waters ran up to the horizon,
and waves were breaking against a chalk cliff. At the
end of the alley there was a semicircular seat. Above
it the huntress Artemis, in short tunic, with crescented
hair, quiver on shoulder, and two deer-hounds at her
feet, looked down on the two young people.
</p><p>
They sat down together. Arsinoë pointed out the
hill of the Acropolis, so distant that the columns of the
Parthenon could hardly be distinguished; and took up
the thread of conversations started at their former
meetings&mdash;
</p><p>
"See how beautiful it is!... And you would destroy
that, Julian?"
</p><p>
Making no reply, he stared on the ground.
</p><p>
"I have thought much over what you said to me
the last time we met, concerning this humility of
yours," continued Arsinoë gently. "Was Alexander
son of Philip of Macedon humble? And nevertheless
is he not great and splendid?"
</p><p>
Julian said nothing.
</p><p>
"And Brutus, Brutus the stabber of Cæsar! Had
Brutus turned the left cheek when struck on the right,
do you think he would have been more sublime? Or,
indeed, perhaps you consider him a criminal, you Galileans?
Why can I not help thinking sometimes,
Julian, that you are a hypocrite; and that these black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
habiliments are not your body's true raiment?"
</p><p>
She turned brusquely towards his moon-lit face and
regarded him steadfastly.
</p><p>
"Arsinoë, what do you want of me?" murmured
Julian, whose cheek was very pale.
</p><p>
"I want you to be frankly my foe!" exclaimed the
young girl. "You must not pass by like this, without
telling me what you are. Sometimes I dream that it
would be better if Rome and Athens were utterly
ruined! Better burn a corpse than leave it unburied!
And all our friends here&mdash;grammarians, rhetoricians&mdash;poets
who write Imperial eulogies&mdash;all these are the
rotting body of Greece and Rome. In their company
one grows afraid, as among the shroudless dead....
Oh, you may triumph, Galileans! Soon corpses and
ruins are all that will remain on earth!... And you,
Julian.... But no!... It is impossible! I do not
believe that you are with them and against Hellas&mdash;against
me!..."
</p><p>
Julian sprang up before her, pale and mute, longing
to burst away. She held him back.
</p><p>
"Tell me that you are my enemy," she said with
heart-broken challenge in her voice.
</p><p>
"Arsinoë!... Why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Tell me all!... I must know. Do you not feel
how near we are? Or are you indeed afraid to
speak?"
</p><p>
"In two days I leave Athens," murmured Julian.
</p><p>
"Why?&mdash;Where are you going?"
</p><p>
"The Emperor has recalled me to Court&mdash;to die
perhaps. I may now be looking at you for the last
time."
</p><p>
"Julian, you do not believe in Him?" cried Arsinoë,
seeking to read the eyes of the monk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
</p><p>
"Speak lower!"
</p><p>
He rose, and striding round cautiously explored the
dusty road silvered by the moon, the bushes, and even
the sea, as if afraid to see sudden-rising spies from the
Emperor. Reassured, he returned and sat down.
Leaning one hand heavily on the marble he brought
his lips close to the ear of Arsinoë&mdash;so near that she
felt his warm breath&mdash;muttering rapidly&mdash;
</p><p>
"Believe in <i>Him</i>?... Listen, girl! I say to you
now what I have never dared to say even to myself. I
hate the Galilean!... But I have lied as long as I
can remember. Lying has soaked into my soul, or
clung to it, as this black vestment clings to my body.
You remember the poisoned shirt of Nessus; Hercules
snatched it off with pieces of his own flesh and it
slew him, all the same. I&mdash;I too shall perish wearing
this Galilean lie!"
</p><p>
He pronounced each word with painful effort.
Arsinoë gazed at him. His face, changed by suffering
and hatred, became the face of a stranger.
</p><p>
"Be calm, friend!" she murmured. "Tell me all.
I shall understand you better than anyone else."
</p><p>
"I should like to be able to speak, but speech is a
power I have lost," sneered Julian. "I have kept
silence too long. Do you understand, Arsinoë? It is
all over with him who has once fallen into their
clutches! These good and humble men deform him
to such a degree&mdash;teach him so thoroughly to lie and to
dissimulate&mdash;that it becomes impossible ever to stand
erect and manful again!"
</p><p>
The blood rushed to his forehead, swelling the veins,
and through clenched teeth he muttered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Cowardice! Foul Galilean cowardice! this&mdash;to
hate your enemy as I hate Constantius, and to pardon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
him, to crouch at his feet, cringe like a serpent, to supplicate
him in the humble Christian manner: 'A year,
grant your weak-witted slave, Julian, another year;
and then do with him as it may please you and your
counsellors, O well-beloved of God!' What baseness!"
</p><p>
"No, Julian," protested Arsinoë, "you will conquer!
Deception is your strength.... Julian, do you
remember Æsop's fable, The Ass in the Lion's Skin?
In this affair of yours the story is reversed; the lion is
in the ass's skin, and the hero in a monkish habit!
And how they will shrink affrighted when you suddenly
show your talons! What joy and what terror! Tell
me, you long for power?"
</p><p>
"Power!" cried Julian, intoxicated at the sound of
the word and inhaling with deep breaths the fresh air
of night&mdash;"power!... oh, only for a year, a few
months, a few days! And I would teach them, I
would teach all these crawling and venomous creatures
what means their Master's word, 'Render unto Cæsar
the things that are Cæsar's'; I swear by the Sun-god
they should render to Cæsar what is his!"
</p><p>
He raised his head, his eyes flashing with rage and
pride and renewed youth. Arsinoë gazed on him with
a smile. But his head soon fell. He sank back on the
bench and crossing his arms on his breast in monkish
fashion he faltered&mdash;
</p><p>
"No, no; why nurse empty dreams? That can
never be. I shall perish. Anger will stifle me.
Listen; every night after passing the day on my knees
in churches, bowed over relics, I go home broken with
fatigue; I fling myself on the bed and sob; yes, bite
my own flesh, to avoid crying out with pain. Oh, you
cannot know yet, Arsinoë, this Galilean horror and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
infection in which I have agonised for twenty years without
escaping by death. We Christians take a deal of
killing,&mdash;worms that live on even when cut in pieces!
At first I used to seek consolation in the teachings of
the diviners and philosophers. It was hopeless. I
follow neither the one nor the other. I am wicked
and I wish to be wickeder still. To be strong and terrible
as the Demon, my only brother.... But why,
why can I not forget that there is beauty in the world;
why, O cruel one, did you dawn upon my life?"
</p><p>
With a quick spontaneous movement Arsinoë flung
her bare arms round Julian's neck, drew him to her so
strongly, so closely, that he felt the whole freshness
of her body, murmuring&mdash;
</p><p>
"And if I did come towards you, O young man,
what if it were as a sibyl to prophesy you glory? You
alone are alive among the dead! Splendour is yours!
What matters it to me that your wings are no swan's
wings, but wings of the black and lost, your talons,
talons of a bird of prey? My love is for all the revolted,
the reprobate, the rejected&mdash;you understand
me, Julian? I love the proud and solitary eagles better
than any stainless swan. Only ... be prouder
yet, be wickeder yet! Dare up to the height of your
ambition! Lie without shame; better lie than be
humiliated. Fear not hate; it is the impetus of your
wings. Come, shall we make an alliance? You shall
give me power, I will give you beauty. Are you willing,
Julian?"
</p><p>
Again through the light folds of her antique peplum,
as once in the <i>palæstra</i>, he saw the breathing image
of the huntress Artemis; it seemed that divine body
shone through, golden and tender.
</p><p>
His head reeled in the lunar shadow enveloping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
them. Those haughty lips laughingly approached his
own.
</p><p>
For the last time he mused. "I must tear myself
away. She does not love me. She will never love
me. Her love is only for power."
</p><p>
But immediately he added to himself, with a faint
smile: "Well, let it be so! I consent to be duped!"
</p><p>
The chill of the strange and insatiate kiss of Arsinoë
shot to his heart like the chill of death. It seemed as if
Artemis herself, in the translucence of the moon, had
descended towards him, embraced him, and mocked
him, and like a beam of moonlight fled away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the following morning Basil of Cæsarea and
Gregory of Nazianzen came across Julian in a basilica
in Athens. He was kneeling in prayer. The two
friends gazed at him, surprised. Never had they seen
upon his features such an expression of rapt serenity.
</p><p>
"Brother," murmured Basil to Gregory, "we have
sinned; he whom we inwardly accused is a righteous
man."
</p><p>
Gregory shook his head.
</p><p>
"May the Lord pardon me if I am deceived," he
said slowly, his piercing eye still on Julian. "But
remember, Basil, how often the Devil himself, the
father of lying, has appeared to men in guise of an
angel!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XV</h2>

<p>On the base of a dolphin-shaped lamp were ranged
the curling irons of a barber. The lamp-light
was growing pale, for rays of morning, falling through
silken window-curtains, were gradually filling the
sleeping chamber with deep violet hues. The curtains
were dyed in the richest hyacinthine purple of Tyre.
</p><p>
"'Hypostasis,' 'hypostasis'? What is the meaning
of the divine hypostasis, or essence, or personality,
of the Trinity? No human being can form any conception.
I myself haven't slept a wink in thinking
over it the whole night. I arrived at no conclusion
but an atrocious headache. Boy, give me towels and
soap!"
</p><p>
So spoke a personage with a tall headdress like a
mitre and the pontifical aspect of a high-priest or Asiatic
tyrant. He was chief barber and wig-maker in attendance
on the sacred person of Constantius. The razor
in his skilful hands was flitting, with an incomparable
grace and lightness, over the Imperial chin. He was
engaged upon a sacred mystery. In attendance on
each side were innumerable <i>cubicularii</i>, slaves holding
vases, essences, oils, and napkins, and two youths
bearing fans. Supervising all these, Eusebius, grand
chamberlain of the private apartments, stood by. He
was the most powerful man in the Empire.
</p><p>
During the ceremony of barbification, as an emperor's
shaving must be called, the two youths refreshed the illustrious
patient by means of great fans, each six-winged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
like the seraphim, or the <i>ripides</i> with which deacons
fan away flies from a sacramental chalice, during
the intoning of the liturgy. The barber had scarcely
finished the Emperor's right cheek and was beginning
the left, which had been anointed with an
Arabian essence named "the foam of Aphrodite."
Leaning to the ear of Constantius he whispered cautiously:
</p><p>
"Ah! Well-beloved of God, your universal intelligence
alone can determine what this hypostasis, this
mysterious personality of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
may mean. Don't listen to the bishops! Act as
pleases yourself, and not as it may please them. But
Athanasius, that patriarch of Alexandria, must be
punished as a blasphemous rebel. Almighty God, the
Creator Himself, will instruct your Holiness as to
what, and in what manner, your subjects ought to
believe. In my humble opinion the Arians are perfectly
right in asserting that there was a time when the
'Son' did not exist. And so consubstantiality...."
</p><p>
But at this moment Constantius was staring at himself
in the great polished silver mirror, and rubbing his
hand over the silky new shaven region on his right
cheek. He interrupted&mdash;
</p><p>
"I don't think that's very smooth!&mdash;eh! I think
you might go over it again. What were you saying
to me about consubstantiality?"
</p><p>
The barber, who had received a talent of gold from
the Court bishops Ursatius and Valentine to prepare the
Emperor for the new profession of faith, was murmuring
insinuatingly in the ear of Constantius and wielding
his razor with the most persuasive delicacy, when at
this moment the chief of the <i>silentiarii</i>, Paul, surnamed
Catena, approached the Emperor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
</p><p>
He was so called because his infamous system of reports
enwound any chosen victim in chains well-nigh
indissoluble. His effeminate face was beardless and
handsome, and judged by externals he seemed the
angel of humility. His dark eyes were full of languor;
his walk, a noiselessly graceful feline motion. He wore
crosswise over the shoulder a wide dark blue ribbon&mdash;sign
of special Imperial favour.
</p><p>
Paul Catena with a subtle and authoritative gesture
waved the barber away, and whispered in the ear of
Constantius&mdash;
</p><p>
"A letter from Julian! Intercepted to-night.
Deign to read it."
</p><p>
Constantius greedily snatched the letter from the
hands of Paul, opened it, and read. Disappointed, he
muttered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Mere trash&mdash;trifles; he sends a present of a hundred
grapes to a sophist and writes the praises of the
fruit and of the number 'a hundred.'"
</p><p>
"Ah! a ruse!" said Catena.
</p><p>
"Really?" asked Constantius; "what proofs are
there?"
</p><p>
"None."
</p><p>
"Then he's either exceedingly cunning or indeed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"What does your Eternity mean?"
</p><p>
"Or, in fact, he is innocent."
</p><p>
"As your Majesty pleases," stammered Paul.
</p><p>
"<i>As I please?</i> I desire to be just, simply just. Are
you not aware of that? I must have proofs...."
</p><p>
"Wait; we shall find them."
</p><p>
Another informer came near, a young Persian named
Mercurius, court-pantler, little more than a lad. He
was feared not less than Paul Catena and had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
pleasantly nicknamed "Chief Diviner of Dreams."
If the prophetic dream could be twisted into any meaning
even remotely unfavourable for the person of the
Emperor, Mercurius would make careful notes of it and
hasten to make a report. Many a victim had paid with
their goods and their prospects for the imprudence of
dreaming what they had no business to dream; and,
aware of this, prudent courtiers would declare themselves
martyrs to insomnia, enviers of the legendary
dwellers in Atlantis, who, according to Plato, are lapt
in slumber without visions. The Persian signed to a
distance two Ethiopian eunuchs who were knotting the
laces of the Emperor's green and gilt shoes. He kissed
the feet of the sovereign, and as it were basked a moment
in his eyes, like a dog who affectionately gazes
up for his master's orders.
</p><p>
"May your Eternity forgive me," whispered little
Mercury, "I could not refrain from running to your
presence. Gaudentius has had a bad dream! You
appeared to him in a torn chlamys and crowned with
blasted ears of corn...."
</p><p>
"What does that mean?"
</p><p>
"The blasted ears announce famine, and the torn
chlamys ... I dare not...."
</p><p>
"Sickness?"
</p><p>
"Worse still, I'm afraid, if possible. Gaudentius'
wife confessed to me that he had consulted the augurs.
God knows what they told him!"
</p><p>
"Well, well! We will discuss it. Come again this
evening."
</p><p>
"No! I will come this afternoon. Permit me to
mention a slight matter, something not so grievous....
There is also the matter of the table-cloths...."
</p><p>
"What table-cloths?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
</p><p>
"Have you forgotten? At a supper in Aquitaine
the table was spread with two table-covers with purple
borders&mdash;borders as wide as those on the Imperial
chlamys!"
</p><p>
"Do you mean to say they were more than two
fingers wide? Remember, I've authorised the width
of two fingers."
</p><p>
"Ah, much, much wider I fear! It was a regular
Imperial chlamys. Can such sacrilege be permitted?"
</p><p>
Mercury did not succeed however in reciting all his
reports:
</p><p>
"At Delphi a monster has been born&mdash;four ears,
four eyes, two snouts, all covered with hair. The
augurs say it is a bad omen&mdash;that the Holy Empire
will be split up...."
</p><p>
"We shall see! we shall see! Write it all down in
due order and submit it to me."
</p><p>
The Emperor went on with his morning toilet. He
consulted his mirror again, and with a fine camel's-hair
brush took up a morsel of rouge from the casket
of filigree silver, shaped like a reliquary and crowned
by a little cross, at his elbow. Constantius was devoutly
religious; enamelled crosses and the monogram
of Christ adorned every trinket in his private rooms.
Exquisite and expensive paint called <i>purpurissima</i>,
extracted from the scum on the purple mollusc while
in a state of ebullition, was specially prepared for him.
Constantius adroitly spread a faint flush of this over
his withered brown cheek. From the room called
Porphyria, where the regal vestments were kept in a
pentagonal wardrobe, eunuchs bore forth the Imperial
dalmatic. It was stiff, heavy with gold, encrusted with
precious stones, and with lions and dragons embroidered
on its amethystine purples.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
</p><p>
In the main hall of the palace on that day was to be
held the great Arian council. The Emperor slowly
took his way thither along a gallery of pierced and
fretted marble. Palace guards, or palatines, two-deep
formed a long lane, mute as statues and holding lances
fourteen cubits long crossed above the head of their
master, as he paced in state between them. Constantine's
banner of cloth of gold, the <i>Labarum</i>, surmounted
by the monogram of Christ, shone rustling behind,
borne by the officer of the Imperial largesses (<i>comes
sacrarum largitionum</i>). Mute body-guards (<i>silentiarii</i>)
heralded the procession, imposing silence on everyone
they met.
</p><p>
In the gallery the Emperor encountered the Empress
Eusebia Aurelia. She was a mature woman with a
pale and weary face, delicate and noble features, a mischievous
raillery sometimes kindling her keen eyes.
Crossing her hands on the <i>omophorium</i> covered with
sapphires and heart-shaped rubies, the Empress bowed
profoundly and pronounced the habitual morning
salutation:
</p><p>
"I am come for the joy of beholding you, O spouse
well-beloved of the Lord! How has your Holiness
deigned to sleep?"
</p><p>
Then, at a sign from her, the attendant maids of
honour drew to a distance and she murmured sweetly,
in a simpler and sincerer tone&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian is to be received by you to-day. Receive
him kindly! Don't believe these spying reports. He
is a poor innocent boy. God will repay you, sire, if
you grant him favour."
</p><p>
"You ask favour to him as a favour to yourself?"
</p><p>
The husband and wife exchanged a rapid glance.
</p><p>
"I know," she said, "you always have confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
in me; let it be so now. Julian is a faithful slave.
Don't refuse me.... Be kind to him...."
</p><p>
And she gratified him with one of those smiles which
hitherto had wielded irresistible power over the heart
of Constantius.
</p><p>
In the portico, which was separated from the great
hall by hangings (behind which the Emperor used to
ensconce himself to hear what was going on at the
councils), a monk, wearing a cruciform tonsure and in
a hooded robe of coarsest drugget, came near. It was
Julian.
</p><p>
"I salute my benefactor, the triumphant and glorious
Emperor Augustus Constantius. May your Holiness
pardon me!"
</p><p>
"We are happy to receive you, my son."
</p><p>
Julian's cousin magnanimously extended his hand
to Julian's lips. Julian kissed the hand dyed with the
blood of his father, of his brother, of all his relatives.
Then he rose erect, pale and with sparkling eyes fixed
upon his enemy. He gripped the handle of a poniard
hidden under his robe. The grey eyes of the Emperor
lighted with pride and cautious malice, seldom dropping
their scrutiny. He was a head shorter than Julian,
large-shouldered, solidly-built, and bandy-legged like
an old cavalry soldier. The tight brown skin over his
temples was disagreeably glossy. The thin lips were
severely closed with the expression of folk that set
order and punctuality above all other virtues&mdash;the expression
of a pedant and a schoolmaster.
</p><p>
To Julian he appeared detestable. He felt an animal
fury getting the better of him, and, unable to utter a
word, his eyes fell and he breathed with difficulty.
</p><p>
Constantius smiled, imagining the young monk unable
to bear the superhuman majesty of the Imperial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
glance. With ostentatious benevolence he continued&mdash;
</p><p>
"Fear nothing! Go in peace! Our kindness shall
bring no danger upon you. On the contrary we shall
from this day forth heap bounties on our cousin who is
an orphan."
</p><p>
Julian bowed and proceeded into the hall of council;
and the Emperor, hidden behind draperies, lent an
ironic and attentive ear to the debate beginning
within.
</p><p>
He immediately recognised the voice of the principal
dignitary of the Imperial post, Gaudentius. It was he
who had suffered from the bad dream.
</p><p>
"One council treads on the heels of another,"
Gaudentius was complaining; "now it's at Sirmio,
now it's at Sardis, now at Antioch, and now here at
Constantinople. They discuss and discuss, but never
come to an understanding. And I would ask you, for
pity's sake, to consider the horses that have to carry
these gentlemen about! Out of a relay of ten horses
you will hardly find one who is not foundered by the
bishops. Another five councils, and my beasts will
only be fit for the knacker's yard&mdash;not a car will have
a wheel on it. Yet, in spite of all, you'll see that the
bishops will still be at loggerheads and boggling at the
Trinity!"
</p><p>
"Why then, Gaudentius, don't you send in a formal
report on the subject to the Emperor?"
</p><p>
"Nobody would believe me. I should be accused
of irreligion and lack of respect for the crying needs
of the Church."
</p><p>
In the vast round hall, crowned by a cupola on
columns of Phrygian marble, the heat was already
stifling. Slanting sun rays fell in through uncurtained
windows. The noise of voices was like the buzzing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
a swarm of bees. The Imperial golden seat&mdash;<i>sella
aurea</i>&mdash;was prepared on a daïs. It rested on lions'
paws of carved ivory, crossed like those of the curule
chairs of Roman consuls.
</p><p>
Close to the throne, the high-priest Paphnutis, with
a face empurpled by argument, was declaring&mdash;
</p><p>
"For my part, I shall keep to the opinions my
fathers taught me! According to the creed of our holy
father Athanasius, patriarch of Alexandria, we must
worship a single God in a Trinity, and the Trinity in
a single God; the Father is God; the Son is God;
the Holy Ghost is God, and nevertheless they form
together but one God!"
</p><p>
And as if he was smashing an invisible enemy he
brought down his enormous right fist into his left-hand
palm and glared triumphantly round the assembly.
</p><p>
"That tradition have I received from my fathers,
and that tradition I will keep!"
</p><p>
"Who is it? What's he saying?" asked Ozius, a
man of a hundred years old, who had been alive in the
time of the council of Nicæa. "Where's my trumpet?"
Harrowing perplexity could be read on his
face. He was deaf, almost blind. The deacon who
accompanied him set the ear-trumpet to his ear.
</p><p>
A certain pale thin monk seized Paphnutis by the
surplice&mdash;
</p><p>
"Father Paphnutis," he shouted to drown the general
clamour, "what is all this about?... It is a
question of a single word; is not that so?" and forthwith
he began to narrate terrible scenes he had witnessed
in Alexandria and Constantinople. The Arians
had opened with wooden pincers the mouths of those
unwilling to receive the Sacrament in heretic churches,
and forced the host between their lips. Mere children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
were subjected to inquisition; the breasts of women
were crushed under leaden weights and branded with
live iron. In the Church of the Holy Apostles so horrible
a struggle had taken place between Arians and
Orthodox that the blood, overflowing the cistern which
received the drainage of the place, had poured down
the steps in front of the western façade and streamed
into the market-square. At Alexandria the governor
Sebastian had caused virgins to be beaten with thorn
branches, so that many of them had succumbed and
their bodies lay unburied outside the city gates. All
this contention was over a single letter, an <i>iota</i>.
</p><p>
"Father Paphnutis," argued the pale monk, "for
an iota! The word 'substantial' does not even occur
in the holy Scripture. What are we then torturing
each other about? Think, Father; it is horrible!"
</p><p>
"Then," interrupted the Arch-priest impatiently,
"must we be reconciled with those impious dogs who
will not hunt out of their pestilent hearts the doctrine
that there was a moment when the Son of God did not
exist?"
</p><p>
"'One Shepherd and one Flock,'" the monk returned:
"Let us make them some concessions!"
</p><p>
But Paphnutis refused to hear anything, vociferating
till the veins of his neck almost burst&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let the enemies of God be silent! Never will I
give in! Anathema on the Arian heresy! Such have
I received the faith from my fathers, and such will I
keep it!"
</p><p>
Ozius the centenarian wagged approvingly his white
head and long beard. On the other side of the hall
two archdeacons were talking together.
</p><p>
"You keep very calm, Father Dorophas. Why are
you taking no part in discussion to-day?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
</p><p>
"My voice is gone, Father Flavius. I am too
hoarse with anathematising the cursed sectaries."
</p><p>
In another group the deacon from Antioch, Aetius,
a bold and fervent disciple of Arius, regarded as an
atheist for his audacious and scoffing interpretations of
the Trinity, was holding forth.
</p><p>
The career of Aetius had been remarkable for its
extraordinary variety. At first a slave, he had afterwards
become by turns a coppersmith, a sailor, a
rhetorician, a pupil and teacher of Alexandrian philosophy,
and finally a deacon.
</p><p>
"God the Father is in His substantial essence different
from His Son," Aetius was saying with a smile
and evident gusto, to the dismay of his hearers.
"The Trinity has differentiations, degrees of glory,
according to the nature of the personalities comprised
in it. The word 'God' cannot be used of the Son,
because He has never applied it to Himself. The Son
has never even comprehended the essence of the Father,
because it is impossible for Him who had a beginning
to imagine that which has neither beginning nor
end."
</p><p>
"Blaspheme not!" shouted an indignant bishop.
"Where is this Satanic boldness going to stop, my
brethren?"
</p><p>
"Drag not the simple-minded into perdition by your
speeches!" shrieked another.
</p><p>
"Prove me wrong by philosophic reasoning, and I
will acquiesce. But shouts and insults are proof of
nothing but impotence," replied Aetius calmly.
</p><p>
"It is written in the Scriptures...."
</p><p>
"What is that to me? God has given intelligence
to man that He himself might be understood. I
believe in logic of argument and not in texts. Reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
with me on the basis of the syllogisms and categories
of Aristotle...."
</p><p>
And with a contemptuous smile he threw his surplice
around him like the cynic mantle of Diogenes.
</p><p>
Some bishops were beginning to speak in favour of
a universal creed in which mutual concession should
be made, when the Arian Narcissus of Neronia, a profound
expert in all statutes, creeds, and canons of the
councils, intervened in discussion. He was a man
little liked, suspected of adultery and usury, but admired
by everyone for his theological erudition.
</p><p>
"That is a flat heresy!" he declared decisively.
</p><p>
"Why is it a heresy?" demanded several voices.
</p><p>
"Because the assizes of Paphlagonia have already so
laid it down."
</p><p>
"The assizes of Paphlagonia?" repeated the desperate
bishops; "we had clean forgotten them. What
is to be done now?"
</p><p>
"May God have pity on us miserable sinners!" the
good bishop Ozius was muttering; "I can no longer
understand anything; I can't get out of the labyrinth;
my head is buzzing, my ears singing with Greek words;
I'm walking in a fog and don't know myself what I
believe in and what I disbelieve; what is heresy and
what is not.... Jesus help us!... We are falling
into the snares of the Devil."
</p><p>
At that moment the hubbub and clamour ceased.
The bishop Ursatius of Singidion, one of the Emperor's
favourites, mounted the tribune. He was holding in
his hand a long scroll of parchment. Two <i>silentiarii</i>,
having mended their fine pens of Egyptian reed,
got ready to write down the conciliar debate. Ursatius
read out the message of the Emperor to the
bishops&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
</p><p>
"Constantius, the triumphant, glorious, and eternal
Augustus, to all bishops assembled in this council...."
</p><p>
The Emperor demanded the dismissal of Athanasius,
the patriarch of Alexandria, whom he called the most
useless of men, the traitor, the accomplice of the insolent
and abominable Magnentius.
</p><p>
The courtiers, Valentine, Eusebius, Axentius, hastened
to sign the scroll. But a murmur arose.
</p><p>
"It is all a damnable device; a trick of the Arians!
We will not let our patriarch suffer...."
</p><p>
"The Emperor calls himself <i>eternal</i> ... nobody is
eternal but God! It is a mockery of holy things."
</p><p>
Constantius, lurking behind the curtain, heard this
last speech distinctly. Thrusting the hangings roughly
by, he pushed unexpectedly into the hall. The lances
of the guard surrounded him. His face expressed
anger. A heavy silence fell upon the throng.
</p><p>
"What is it, what is it?" the blind Ozius kept
whispering in restless perplexity.
</p><p>
"Fathers," the Emperor began, bridling his anger,
"allow me, the servant of the Most High, to use
my zeal under His providence to a successful issue.
Athanasius is a rebel, the chief violator of universal
concord and &oelig;cumenical peace."
</p><p>
Fresh murmurs arose. Constantius was silent and
ran a surprised look over the array of bishops. A
voice shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Anathema upon the abominable Arian heresy!"
</p><p>
"The faith against which you revolt," replied the
Emperor, "is my faith. If it is heretical, why has
the omnipotent God assigned victory to us over all our
enemies? Constans, Vetranio, Gallus, the abominable
Magnentius, why has God Himself placed the power
over the world in our sacred hands?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
</p><p>
The bishops were dumb; then the courtier Valentius,
bishop of Mursa, bowing with great servility&mdash;
</p><p>
"God will unveil the truth to your wisdom, sire,
well-beloved of the Lord! What you believe cannot
be heresy. Did not Cyril of Jerusalem behold a rainbow-surmounted
cross in the heavens on the day of
your victory over Magnentius?"
</p><p>
"It is my will," interrupted Constantius, rising
from the throne. "Athanasius shall be laid low by
the power God has entrusted to me. Pray that all
these conflicts and controversies may cease, that the
murderous heresy of the Sabæans, the partisans of
Athanasius, may be destroyed, that the truth may
shine into all hearts...."
</p><p>
Suddenly the Emperor grew pale; the words expired
on his lips.
</p><p>
"What! How is it that he has been allowed to
enter?"
</p><p>
He pointed to a tall old man with a severe and
majestic face. It was the bishop Hilarion of Pictavia
(Poitiers), who had been exiled and ruined for his
faith, one of the greatest enemies of the Arian Emperor.
He had come to the council unsummoned, perhaps
seeking martyrdom. The old man raised his
hand to heaven as if calling down malediction upon
the head of the Emperor, and his powerful voice
thrilled the silent crowd&mdash;
</p><p>
"Brothers, Christ must be about to descend, for
Antichrist has already conquered, and that Antichrist
is Constantius! He does not break your backs on the
wheel, but he flatters your proud bellies. He does not
throw us into dungeons, but entices us into his palaces....
Emperor, hearken! I say to you what I have said
to Nero, Decius, Maximian, all persecutors of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Church. But you are not, like them, the murderer of
men, but the murderer of the Divine love itself! Nero,
Decius, Maximian, have better served the God of truth
than you! In their reign we conquered the Devil, the
blood of the martyrs flowed, cleansing the earth, and
their dead bones worked miracles. Whereas you, O
King, cruellest of the cruel, slay and yet grant us not the
glory of death.... Lord, send us a true despot like
Nero, and let the kindly arm of Thy wrath revive again
the Church dishonoured by the kiss of this Judas!"
</p><p>
The Emperor sprang to his feet&mdash;
</p><p>
"Seize him and the rebels!" he ejaculated, half-choked
with rage, pointing to Hilarion.
</p><p>
The guards flung themselves on the bishops.
</p><p>
The crowd became a wild and indescribable mob
illumined by the flashing of swords. Roman soldiers,
snatching off the breastplate, stole, and chasuble of
Hilarion, dragged the old man away. Many present
rushed in mad panic to the doors, fell, and were
trampled underfoot by the rest. One of the recording
clerks leapt on the sill of a window, but a soldier
pinned him there by his long vestments and would not
release him. The table and the inkstands were upset,
red ink poured over the blue jasper floor, and voices
shouted at the sight of the crimson sea&mdash;
</p><p>
"Blood! blood! blood!"
</p><p>
Others howled&mdash;
</p><p>
"Death to the enemies of the thrice-pious Augustus!"
</p><p>
Paphnutis in a thunderous monotone persisted in
crying while the guards dragged him away&mdash;
</p><p>
"I recognise the council of Nicæa!... Anathema
on the Arian heresy!"
</p><p>
Others screamed&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
</p><p>
"Be silent, enemies of God! Anathema! the council
of Nicæa! the assizes of Sardis! the canons of
Paphlagonia!"
</p><p>
Blind Ozius remained seated motionless, forgotten by
all, in his episcopal chair, murmuring inaudibly&mdash;
</p><p>
"Jesus Christ, Son of God, have pity upon us!
What is the matter, my brethren, what is it?"
</p><p>
In vain he stretched feeble hands towards his terrified
friends. Nobody saw him, nobody heard him;
and tears streamed down his aged cheeks.
</p><p>
Meanwhile Julian watched all, a contemptuous smile
upon his lips, full of inward triumph.
</p><p>
On the same day, late in the evening, in a quiet and
solitary defile two Mesopotamian monks were journeying
afoot together. They had been sent by Syrian
bishops to the council, had escaped the palatine guards
with great difficulty, and now, their minds at peace,
were proceeding towards Ravenna to embark as quickly
as possible upon the ship which was to restore them to
the desert. Fatigue and sadness were on their faces.
Ephraim, one of the two, was extremely old; the
other, Pimenus, a lad.
</p><p>
Ephraim said to Pimenus&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is time to regain the desert, brother. Better to
hear the howling of jackal and lion than the cry that
dinned our ears in the Imperial palace. Happy are
those who speak not. Happy those who hide themselves
in desert places, beyond arguments of masters
of the Church, who have understood the uselessness of
words; who debate nothing. Happy is he who seeks
not to understand God's mysteries, but who, merging
his spirit into Thine, sings to Thy face, O Lord, like
a harp; understanding how difficult it is to know, how
easy to love Thee!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
</p><p>
Ephraim was silent, and Pimenus murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Amen!"
</p><p>
The quiet of night enveloped the pair, and courageously,
steering by the stars, the two monks took
their way eastwards rejoicing in the majesty of their
barren road.

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XVI</h2>

<p>The city of Milan lay basking in the sun; and by
every street the crowd was turning its steps
towards the chief public square.
</p><p>
Tremendous acclamations ran through the throng,
and in the triumphant chariot, drawn by twenty horses
white as swans, appeared the Emperor. His chariot seat
was so lofty that the people were obliged to throw
their heads back to behold him. His robes, besown
with precious stones, sparkled dazzlingly in the sun.
In his right hand he held the sceptre, in the left the
Imperial globe crested by a cross.
</p><p>
Motionless as a statue, outrageously painted, he
looked straight before him without turning his head,
which was held stiff as in a vice. During the whole
journey, and despite the joltings of the car, the Emperor
stirred not a finger, nor coughed, nor blinked the
steady stare of his eyes.
</p><p>
Constantius had acquired this immobility by years
of effort, and was particularly proud of it, considering
it an indispensable part of Imperial etiquette. On
such occasions he would have preferred to undergo
torture rather than betray his mortal nature by sneezing,
coughing, or wiping off the sweat which stood in
beads on his forehead.
</p><p>
Although squat and bow-legged he imagined himself
gigantic. When the chariot disappeared under
the arch of triumph, not far from the baths of Maximian
Hercules, the Emperor bowed his head as if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
were afraid of striking his head against the lofty gates
which would have freely taken a Cyclops beneath
them.
</p><p>
Each side of the road was lined with palatine guards
helmeted and cuirassed in gold, the two ranks of the
bodyguard flashing in the sun like streams of lightning.
</p><p>
Round the Imperial chariot great dragon-shaped
standards were floating. The purple stuff, swollen by
the wind engulfed in the gullets of the monsters, gave
out a shrill sound like the hiss of snakes, and the long
purple tails of the dragons wavered to and fro above
the people. In the Forum were drawn up all the
legions quartered in Milan. Thunders of applause
welcomed the Emperor. Constantius was pleased.
The noise had neither been too feeble nor too tumultuous.
Arranged beforehand according to the strictest
etiquette, the soldiers had been instructed to be enthusiastic
with moderation and respect.
</p><p>
Giving each of his motions a kind of stiff and pedantic
emphasis, Constantius solemnly descended from the
chariot and went up to the tribune raised above the
square. It was draped with ragged standards of old
victories and studded with metal eagles.
</p><p>
The trumpets sounded up anew in the call denoting
that the leader desired to speak to his army. The
Forum was instantly hushed.
</p><p>
"<i>Optimi reipublicæ defensores!</i>" began Constantius.
(Excellent defenders of the Republic.)
</p><p>
The discourse was long-winded, tedious, full of
scholastic flowers of rhetoric.
</p><p>
Julian in Court dress now ascended the steps of the
tribune, and the fratricide invested the last descendant
of Constantius Chlorus with the sacred purple of the
Cæsars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
</p><p>
The sunlight filtered through the thin silk when the
Emperor raised the purple to enrobe the kneeling
Julian. The rich hue tinged the pale face of the new
Cæsar, who murmured inwardly the prophetic verse
of the Iliad&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Eyes closed by purple death and puissant Destiny...."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And nevertheless Constantius was welcoming him:
</p><p>
"<i>Recepisti primævus originis tuæ splendidum florem,
amatissime mihi omnium frater.</i>" (Still young, you
have attained already the flower of your royal birth,
most beloved of all my brothers!)
</p><p>
An enthusiastic roar rose from the legions. Constantius
became rather gloomy; that shout had slightly
exceeded the proper bounds. Julian must have pleased
the soldiers.
</p><p>
"Glory and prosperity to Cæsar Julian!" They
cheered louder and louder, till it seemed as if they
would never cease.
</p><p>
The new Cæsar thanked the legionaries with a kindly
smile, and every soldier clashed his buckler against his
knee as a sign of rejoicing.
</p><p>
It seemed to Julian that it was not by the will of the
Emperor, but by the will of the gods, that he had
reached this eminence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Every evening Constantius was in the habit of consecrating
a quarter of an hour to the polishing of his
nails. It was one of the few toilet delicacies that he
permitted himself, being sober, unimaginative, and
rather gross than effeminate in all his habits. Paring
his nails with little files, polishing them with minute
brushes, he gaily asked his favourite eunuch, the grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
chamberlain Eusebius, on the evening of the day of
investiture&mdash;
</p><p>
"How soon do you think will Julian conquer the
Gauls?"
</p><p>
"I think," answered Eusebius, "that the next
news we shall receive will be of the defeat and death
of that young man!"
</p><p>
"Really?&mdash;that would give me much pain! But I
have done, don't you think, everything that lay in my
power.... Henceforth he has only himself to
blame...."
</p><p>
Constantius smiled, and bowing his head admired
his nails.
</p><p>
"You have conquered Magnentius," murmured the
eunuch, "you have conquered Vetranio, Constans,
Gallus. You will conquer Julian. Then there will be
but one shepherd, one flock, God and you alone."
</p><p>
"Yes, yes. But, putting Julian on one side, there
is still Athanasius. I shall never be happy until, living
or dead, he shall have fallen into my hands."
</p><p>
"Julian is more to be feared than Athanasius, and
you have invested him to-day in the purple of death.
Oh, wisdom of Providence, destroying by inscrutable
means all the enemies of Your Eternity! Glory be to
the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,
now and during the night of ages!"
</p><p>
"Amen," concluded the Emperor, having finished
the toilet of his nails and thrown away the last minute
brush. He approached the ancient banner of Constantine,
the Labarum, which stood always in the sleeping-chamber,
knelt down, and contemplating the monogram
of Christ which shone in the flicker of the still-burning
lamp, began his prayers. He accomplished exactly the
prescribed number of salves and signs of the cross,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
addressing God with an imperturbable faith, as one
who never doubts his own worth and acceptability.
</p><p>
The three-quarters of an hour of devotions having
elapsed, Constantius arose with a light heart. Eunuchs
undressed him. He lay down on an Imperial
couch propped by cherubim of silver on outspread
wings, and fell asleep in placid innocence with a child like
smile on his lips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XVII</h2>

<p>At Athens, in one of the most frequented cross-roads,
a statue modelled by Arsinoë&mdash;<i>The victorious
Octavius holding up the head of Brutus</i>&mdash;was
exhibited to the people, and the Athenians welcomed
in the daughter of the senator Helvidius Priscus a
renewer of the art of their golden age. But the special
dignitaries whose business was to keep watch on the
public temper, officers strangely but rightly nicknamed
"Inquisitors," reported to the proper quarters that the
statue might arouse liberal sentiments in the people.
A resemblance to Julian was discovered in the face of
Brutus, and in the work as a whole a criminal allusion
to the recent punishment of Gallus. Attempts were
made to discover in Octavius some analogy to the
Emperor Constantius. The affair took the proportions
of an act of treason, and almost fell into the hands of
Paul Catena. Luckily the Imperial chanceries sent
direct a severe order to the local magistrate, that not
only should the statue disappear from the cross-roads,
but that it should be broken to pieces under the eyes of
government officials.
</p><p>
Arsinoë wished to hide the statue, but Hortensius
was in such mortal affright that he threatened to give
up his ward herself to the informers.
</p><p>
In deep disgust at the degradation of the public,
Arsinoë allowed them to do with her work everything
that Hortensius desired, and masons broke up the figure.
</p><p>
Arsinoë hastily left Athens, her guardian having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
persuaded her to follow him to Rome, where friends
had long promised him the office of Imperial quæstor.
They installed themselves in a house not far from the
Palatine Hill.
</p><p>
Days flowed by in inactivity, Arsinoë realising that
there was no longer scope for the greatness and freedom
of antique art. She bore in mind her conversation
with Julian at Athens; and it was the only link which
restrained her from suicide. The long suspense of inaction
seemed to her intolerable. In moments of discouragement
she longed to have done with it all, to
leave all, to set out for the Gallic battlefield and at
the side of the young Cæsar attain power, or perish.
</p><p>
But she fell seriously ill. In the long and calm days
of convalescence she found a devoted consoler in her
most faithful adorer, Anatolius, a centurion of the Imperial
cavalry, son of a rich merchant of Rhodes.
</p><p>
He was a Roman centurion, as he used to say himself,
merely as the result of a mistake, having only
taken to the military career to satisfy the empty-headed
ambition of his father, who desired as the summit of
earthly honour to see his son clothed in gilt armour.
</p><p>
Evading discipline by generous gifts, Anatolius
passed his life in luxurious idleness, amidst works of
art and books, in feastings and indolent and costly
travel. The profound lucidity of soul which had characterised
ancient Epicureans was not possessed by this
modern. He complained to his friends&mdash;
</p><p>
"I suffer from a mortal malady...."
</p><p>
They would ask him dubiously&mdash;
</p><p>
"What malady?"
</p><p>
And he would say&mdash;
</p><p>
"What you call my spirit of irony and what seems
to me melancholy madness."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
</p><p>
His finely cut delicate features expressed extreme
fatigue. Sometimes he would awake as from a sleep,
undertake a wild excursion with fishermen in a hurricane
in the open sea, or set off to hunt wild boar and
bear, or contemplate hatching a plot against the life of
Cæsar, or seek initiation into the terrible mysteries of
Mithra and Adonis. On such occasions he was capable
of astonishing by his rashness and audacity even those
persons who were ignorant of his ordinary way of living.
</p><p>
But the excitement once evaporated he would return
to listlessness and lassitude, still more sleepy, still
more cynical and sad.
</p><p>
"Nothing can be done with you, Anatolius," Arsinoë
used to say to him; "you are so soft that people might
think you had no bones."
</p><p>
But she felt a kind of Hellenic grace in this last of
the Epicureans; liked to read in his weary eyes their
melancholy mockery of himself and everything else.
He would say&mdash;
</p><p>
"The sage can extract enjoyment from the blackest
melancholy, as bees of Hymettus make their best
honey with the juice of bitterest plants!" and his
gossip soothed Arsinoë, who smilingly used to call
Anatolius her physician.
</p><p>
In reality she became stronger, but never returned to
her studio. The sight of chips of marble filled her
with painful memories.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, at the time of which we are speaking
Hortensius was preparing wonderful public games in
the Flavian Theatre, in honour of his arrival in Rome.
He was continually travelling, and busy receiving
horses, lions, bears, Scots wolf-dogs, crocodiles from
the tropics, and with these, flocks of intrepid hunters,
skilled riders, comedians, and gladiators.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
</p><p>
The date of the performance was approaching, and
the lions had not arrived from Tarentum, where they
had disembarked. The bears had grown thin, famished,
timid as lambs.
</p><p>
Hortensius became sleepless with anxiety.
</p><p>
Two days before the festival, the gladiators, Saxon
prisoners, proud and fearless men for whom he had
paid a colossal sum, considering it a disgrace to serve
as a sport for the Roman populace, committed suicide
by cutting their own throats at night in their prison.
</p><p>
Hortensius, at that unexpected news, nearly went
out of his mind. Now all hope concentrated itself on
the crocodiles, which excited the special curiosity of
the mob.
</p><p>
"Have you tried giving them newly-killed hogs'
flesh?" demanded the senator of the slave entrusted
with the supervision of these precious beasts.
</p><p>
"Yes; but they won't eat it."
</p><p>
"Have you tried veal?"
</p><p>
"They won't touch that, either."
</p><p>
"And wheaten bread soaked in cream?"
</p><p>
"They turn away from it and go to sleep."
</p><p>
"They must be ill or too fatigued."
</p><p>
"We've even opened their jaws and shoved the
food down their throats. They cough it up again."
</p><p>
"Ah! by Jupiter, those foul beasts will be the death
of me! We must release them after the first day in the
arena or else they will die of hunger," groaned Hortensius
falling into a chair.
</p><p>
Arsinoë contemplated him with envy. He at least
was not tired of life.
</p><p>
She passed into an isolated chamber whence the
windows looked down on the garden. There in the
calm moonlight her young sister Myrrha, who was now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
about sixteen years old, was softly touching the strings
of a harp, and the notes were falling like tears. Arsinoë
kissed Myrrha, who answered her by a smile
without ceasing to play. A loud whistle sounded
behind the garden wall:
</p><p>
"It is he," said Myrrha, rising. "Come quickly!"
</p><p>
She grasped Arsinoë's hand tightly. The two
young girls threw black cloaks over their shoulders
and went out. The wind was chasing the clouds
along, and the moon, sometimes hidden, sometimes
shone out brightly. Arsinoë opened a door in the
outer wall of the house. A young man wrapped in a
monk's hooded mantle was awaiting them.
</p><p>
"We are not late, Juventinus?" asked Myrrha.
</p><p>
"I was afraid that you were not coming!"
</p><p>
They walked long and rapidly down narrow lanes,
then out among the vineyards, issuing at length into
the Roman plain. In the distance the brick-built
aqueduct of Servius Tullius was outlined against the
sky. Juventinus turned round and said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Somebody is following us!"
</p><p>
The two young girls turned round also. A flood of
moonlight fell upon them, and the individual following
them exclaimed cheerfully&mdash;
</p><p>
"Arsinoë! Myrrha!... And so I have found
you again! Where are you going?"
</p><p>
"We're going among the Christians," answered
Arsinoë. "Come with us, Anatolius; you will see
some curious things."
</p><p>
"What do I hear? Among the Christians?&mdash;You
have always been their enemy!" wondered the centurion.
</p><p>
"With age, my friend, one grows better and more
tolerant, or indifferent, if you like to call it so. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
is a superstition neither better nor worse than other
superstitions. And then one is capable of a good deal
when bored. I am going among them for Myrrha's
sake; it pleases her...."
</p><p>
"Where is the church? We're out in the plain,"
murmured Anatolius.
</p><p>
"The churches are destroyed or profaned by their
fellow-Christians, the Arians, who believe in Christ
otherwise than they do. You must have heard the
debates about it at Court. So now the adversaries of
the Arians are wont to pray in secret in subterranean
vaults, as in the time of the first persecutions."
</p><p>
Myrrha and Juventinus had lingered a little behind
the others; Arsinoë and Anatolius could talk freely.
</p><p>
"Who is he?" asked the centurion with a nod
towards Juventinus.
</p><p>
"The last scion of the ancient patrician family of
the Furii," answered Arsinoë. "The mother wishes
to make a consul of him. His only dream is to flee
into some Thebaïd, or monkish community in the
desert, to spend his days in prayer. He loves his
mother and hides himself from her as from an enemy."
</p><p>
"The descendants of the Furii, monks?... 'T is
a queer age," sighed the Epicurean.
</p><p>
They approached the <i>arenarium</i>, old excavations in
crumbling tufa, and went down narrow steps to the
bottom of the quarry. The volcanic blocks of red
earth looked strange-hued in the moonlight. Juventinus
took a little clay lamp from a dark niche, and
lighted it; the long flame flickered feebly in its narrow
gullet.
</p><p>
They entered the darkness of the side galleries of
the <i>arenarium</i>. Hollowed by the ancient Romans, the
quarry was large and spacious and descended in steep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
slopes. It was therefore pierced by numerous galleries,
for the use of workmen in transporting the tufa. Juventinus
led his companions through the labyrinth
and halted at last in front of a shaft from which he
lifted the coverlid of wood; the party went cautiously
down the damp and slippery steps; at the bottom was
a narrow door; Juventinus knocked; the door opened,
and a grey-headed monk introduced them into a passage
hollowed in harder tufa. The walls on both sides from
floor to vaulting were covered with slabs of marble, the
seals of tombs in which coffins (<i>loculi</i>) were ranged.
</p><p>
At every step folk carrying lamps came to meet
them. By the flickering light Anatolius read with
curiosity on one of these stone flags: "Dorotheus, son
of Felix, in this place of coolness, light, and peace,
reposes" ("<i>requiescit in loco refrigii, luminis, pacis</i>").
On another: "Brethren, disturb not my deep slumber."
</p><p>
The style of the inscriptions was radiant and happy:
"Sophronia, beloved, thou art alive for ever in God"
("<i>Sophronia, dulcis, semper vivis Deo</i>"). And a little
farther on: "<i>Sophronia vivis!</i>" ("Sophronia, thou
livest!") as if he who had written these words had at
length realised that there was no more death.
</p><p>
Nowhere was it written "He is buried here," but
only "Here is laid for a certain time" (<i>depositus</i>). It
seemed as if millions of people, generation upon generation,
were lying in this place, not dead, but fallen
asleep, all full of mysterious expectation. In the
niches lamps were placed. They burned in the close
atmosphere with a long steady flame and graceful vases
exhaled penetrating odours. Nothing but the faint
smell of putrefying bones, which escaped by fissures
in the coffins, gave any hint of death.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
</p><p>
The passages went down lower and lower, curved as
round an amphitheatre; and here and there in the
ceiling a large aperture gave light from <i>luminaria</i>
opening on the country without.
</p><p>
Sometimes a weak moon-ray passing down the <i>luminaria</i>
would strike at the bottom on a slab of marble
covered with inscriptions.
</p><p>
At the end of one of these passages they saw a sexton
who, chanting gaily, was hollowing the ground
with heavy blows of his pick. Several Christians were
standing near the principal inspector of the tombs, the
<i>fossor</i>. He was very well dressed and had a fat cunning
face. The <i>fossor</i> had inherited a right freely to
dispose of a gallery of catacombs, and to sell unoccupied
sites in his gallery, which was all the more appreciated
because in it were buried the relics of St.
Laurence. Although rich, the <i>fossor</i> was keenly bargaining,
as they came up, with a wealthy and miserly
leather-merchant. Arsinoë stopped a moment to hear
the discussion.
</p><p>
"And my tomb will be far away from the relics?"
the leather-dresser was asking mistrustfully, thinking
of the big sum exacted by the <i>fossor</i>.
</p><p>
"No, just six cubits away."
</p><p>
"Above or beneath?"
</p><p>
"On the right-hand side, sloping down a little. It's
an excellent position; I don't ask a penny too much.
Though you be as sinful as you please, everything will
be forgiven. You will go straight into the heavenly
kingdom."
</p><p>
With an expert hand the gravedigger took the
measurements for the tomb as a tailor measures for a
coat, the leather-dresser insisting that he should have
as much room as possible in order to lie in comfort.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
</p><p>
An old woman approached the sexton.
</p><p>
"What do you want, mother?"
</p><p>
"Here's the money&mdash;the extra payment!"
</p><p>
"What extra payment?"
</p><p>
"For the right-hand tomb."
</p><p>
"Ah, I see; you don't want the crooked one?"
</p><p>
"No; my old bones crack at the very idea of the
crooked one."
</p><p>
In the catacombs, and especially near the relics, so
much value was set upon grave-sites that it was necessary
to contrive slanting tombs which were leased to
the poor.
</p><p>
"God knows how long one will have to wait for the
resurrection," the old woman was explaining; "and
if I took a tomb on the slant it would be all very well
to begin with, but when I got tired it wouldn't do at
all."
</p><p>
Anatolius listened in astonishment.
</p><p>
"It is much more curious than the mysteries of
Mithra," he observed to Arsinoë with a languid smile.
"Pity that I didn't know it sooner. I've never seen
such an amusing cemetery."
</p><p>
They went on into a rather large chamber called the
<i>cubicula of consolation</i>. A multitude of small lamps
were burning on the walls. The priest was at the
evening office, the stone lid of a martyr's tomb placed
under an arched vault (<i>arcosolium</i>) serving as altar.
There were many of the faithful in long white robes,
every face serenely happy. Myrrha, kneeling with
eyes full of love, was gazing at the Good Shepherd
pictured on the ceiling of the chamber. In the catacombs
early Christian customs had been revived, so
that after the liturgy all present, looking on themselves
as brothers and sisters, gave each other the kiss of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
peace. Arsinoë following the general example with a
smile kissed Anatolius.
</p><p>
Then all four climbed again toward the upper
storeys, whence they could take their way to the
secret retreat of Juventinus, an old pagan tomb, a
<i>columbarium</i>, lying at some distance from the Appian
Way. There, while waiting for the ship which was to
take him to Egypt, the land of holy anchorites, he was
living hidden from the searches of his mother and of
government officials. He lodged with Didimus, a
good old man from the Lower Thebaïd, to whom
Juventinus gave blind and unquestioning obedience.
</p><p>
Here they found Didimus squatting on his heels,
weaving basket-work. The moon-rays, filtering
through a narrow opening, glinted on his white hair
and long beard. From top to bottom of the walls of
the <i>columbarium</i> were little niches like pigeons' nests,
and each of these contained a mortuary urn.
</p><p>
Myrrha, of whom the old man was very fond, kissed
his withered hand respectfully, and prayed him to tell
her some story about the hermit fathers of the desert.
Nothing pleased her better than these wonderful and
terrible tales by Didimus.
</p><p>
The company grouped themselves round the white-headed
old man, Myrrha watching him with feverish
eyes and feeble hands clasped to her heaving breast.
Nothing was heard save his voice and the distant hum
of Rome, when suddenly, at the inner door communicating
with the catacomb, a knock was heard.
</p><p>
Juventinus rose, went to the door and asked, without
opening it&mdash;
</p><p>
"Who is there?"
</p><p>
No answer came, but a still gentler knock as of
entreaty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
</p><p>
With great precaution Juventinus held the door ajar,
shuddered and recoiled. A woman of tall stature came
into the <i>columbarium</i>. Long white vestments enveloped
her and a veil hid her face. Her gait was that of one
recovering from an illness or of a very old woman.
With a sudden movement she raised the veil and
Juventinus cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"My mother!"
</p><p>
Didimus rose, a severe expression on his countenance.
</p><p>
The woman threw herself at the feet of her son and
kissed them, grey tresses falling dishevelled over her
lean and haggard face, which bore traces of high
patrician beauty. Juventinus took the head of his
mother between his hands and kissed it.
</p><p>
"Juventinus!" the old man called.
</p><p>
The young man made no response.
</p><p>
His mother, as if they had been completely alone,
murmured hastily and joyously&mdash;
</p><p>
"O my son, I thought I should never see you again;
I would have set out for Alexandria&mdash;O I would have
found you even in the desert! But now all is over, is
it not? Tell me that you will not go! Wait until I
die! Afterwards do what you will...."
</p><p>
The old man resumed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do you hear me, Juventinus?"
</p><p>
"Old man," answered the patrician mother, "you
will not carry off a son from her that bore him!...
Listen, if it must be so, I will deny the faith of my
fathers; I will believe in the Crucified!... I will
become a nun!"
</p><p>
"Ah, pagan! thou canst not understand the law of
Christ. A mother cannot be a nun, nor can a nun be
still a mother."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
</p><p>
"I have borne him in anguish; he is mine!"
</p><p>
"It is not the soul, but the body, that you love."
</p><p>
The patrician woman cast at Didimus a look full of
hatred.
</p><p>
"Be then accursed for your lying speeches," she
exclaimed; "accursed, you stealers of children&mdash;tempters
of the guileless! ye black-robed fearers of the
celestial light&mdash;slaves of the Crucified! destroyers of
all beauty and joy!"
</p><p>
Her face changed; she drew her son yet closer, and
said chokingly&mdash;
</p><p>
"I know thee, my son! thou wilt not go ... thou
canst not...."
</p><p>
Old Didimus, cross in hand, stood at the open door
leading to the catacombs. He said solemnly&mdash;
</p><p>
"For the last time, and in the name of God, I order
you, my son, to follow me and to leave her."
</p><p>
Then the patrician relaxed her hold of Juventinus,
and faltered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Then go! Let it be so.... Leave me, if thou
canst!"
</p><p>
Tears flowed no longer down her furrowed cheeks;
her arms fell rigid, with a heart-broken gesture, to her
sides. She waited. All were silent.
</p><p>
"O Lord, help me ... inspire me!" Juventinus
prayed in terrible distress.
</p><p>
"He who will follow Me, and will not hate father
and mother, wife and children, brother and sister, and
even his own life, can never be My disciple!"
</p><p>
These words were recited by Didimus, turning for
the last time towards Juventinus&mdash;
</p><p>
"Remain in the world! Thou hast rejected Christ!
Be accursed in this age and in the age to come!"
</p><p>
"No, no! Cast me not out, father! I am on your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
side. Lord, here am I," exclaimed Juventinus following
his master.
</p><p>
His mother made no arresting movement; not a
muscle of her face stirred; but when the noise of his
footsteps died away a hoarse sob heaved her breast and
she fell into a swoon.
</p><p>
"Open&mdash;in the name of the most holy Emperor
Constantius!"
</p><p>
It was the summons of soldiery sent by the prefect
to hunt the Sabæan rebels, on the denunciation of the
patrician mother of Juventinus.
</p><p>
With a powerful lever the soldiers attempted to prise
open the door of the <i>columbarium</i>, shaking the edifice
on its foundations. The little silver urns vibrated
plaintively under the blows. Half of the door gave
way.
</p><p>
Anatolius, Myrrha, and Arsinoë rushed into the
inner gallery. The Christians hurried along the narrow
passages like ants disturbed in their mound, making
for all the secret outlets communicating with the
quarry. But Arsinoë and Myrrha, unfamiliar with
the exact situation of the galleries, lost their way in
the labyrinth and at last reached the lowest floor of all
at a depth of fifty cubits under ground. It became
difficult to breathe; muddy water lay under foot. The
flame of the lamps became dim and almost blew out.
Putrid miasmas filled the air. Myrrha felt her head
swim and gradually lost consciousness.
</p><p>
Anatolius took her in his arms. At every step they
feared to encounter the legionaries; all the outlets
might be blocked and sealed up; they were running
the risk of being buried alive.
</p><p>
At last they heard the voice of Juventinus calling&mdash;
</p><p>
"Here! here!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
</p><p>
Bent double, he was carrying the old Didimus on his
back.
</p><p>
At the end of a few minutes they reached a secret
door opening on the Campagna.
</p><p>
On returning to the house, Arsinoë quickly undressed
Myrrha and put her to bed, still in a dead
faint. Kneeling by her side the elder sister long
kissed and chafed the thin, yellow, and inert hands.
A pang of agonising presentiment shot through her
heart.
</p><p>
The face of the sleeper bore a strange expression.
Never had it reflected so bodiless a charm. All the
little body seemed transparent and frail as the sides of
an alabaster jar illumined by an inner fire.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XVIII</h2>

<p>Late one evening in a marshy wood not far from
the Rhine, between the fortified post, <i>Tres Tabernæ</i>
and the Roman town of Argentoratum,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> conquered
a short time previously by the <i>Alemanni</i>, two soldiers
who had lost their way were slouching along. One
named Aragaris, an awkward and red-headed giant, a
Sarmatian in the Roman service; the other Strombix,
a lean and frowning little Syrian.
</p><p>
The spaces between the trunks of trees were densely
dark. A fine rain was falling through warm air. The
birches diffused an odour of damp leaves, and far off a
cuckoo was calling.
</p><p>
At every crack of the branches the startled Strombix
began to quake and seized the fist of his companion.
</p><p>
"Oh, cousin! cousin!"
</p><p>
He used to call Aragaris cousin, not through blood
relationship, but for friendship's sake. They had been
taken into the Roman army from opposite ends of the
world. The northern barbarian, a huge guzzler but a
chaste liver, despised the voluptuous and timid Syrian
who was so frugal in his eating and drinking. But
while mocking him he pitied him as a child.
</p><p>
"Cousin!" wailed Strombix.
</p><p>
"Well, what is it? Can't you be quiet?"
</p><p>
"Are there bears in this wood?"
</p><p>
"Yes!" answered Aragaris sullenly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
</p><p>
"And suppose we met one, eh?"
</p><p>
"We should knock him on the head, sell his skin,
and go and drink."
</p><p>
"And suppose the bear, instead of being killed..."
</p><p>
"Poltroon! it isn't difficult to see that you're a
Christian!"
</p><p>
"Why must a Christian be a coward?" said Strombix
with a vexed air.
</p><p>
"You've told me yourself that in your Book it is
written <i>whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek turn to
him the other also</i>."
</p><p>
"True."
</p><p>
"Well, I'm right; and if so, to my thinking you
mustn't go to wars; the enemy will strike you on
one cheek and you turn him round the other. You're
a set of cowards, I say."
</p><p>
"The Cæsar Julian's a Christian, and <i>he</i> isn't a
coward!" retorted Strombix.
</p><p>
"I know, my boy," continued Aragaris, "that you
can pardon enemies when you have to fight them, poor
chicken! Your belly is no bigger than my fist. With
a clove in it you're fed up for the whole day; and so
your blood is no better than marsh-water!"
</p><p>
"Ah, cousin! cousin!" observed Strombix reproachfully,
"why did you talk about food? Now
I've got another gnawing ache in my stomach. Give
me a little garlic! There's some left in your bag."
</p><p>
"If I give you what there's left we shall both starve
to-morrow in this forest!"
</p><p>
"Ah, but if you don't give me some now, I shall
fall from weakness and you will be obliged to carry
me."
</p><p>
"Well, stuff and swill, dog!"
</p><p>
"And a little bread too," begged Strombix.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
</p><p>
Aragaris gave him, with an oath, his last ration of
biscuit. He himself had eaten overnight enough for
two days, of fat pork and bean pottage.
</p><p>
"Attention! Hark!" he said halting. "There's
a trumpet! We're not far from the camp. We must
steer round to the north.... I don't mind bears,"
added Aragaris thoughtfully, "but that centurion..."
</p><p>
The soldiers had nicknamed this hated centurion
"Cedo Alteram," because he used to cry out gleefully
every time he broke the rod with which he was striking
a delinquent, <i>Cedo alteram!</i> that is to say, "Give us
another!"
</p><p>
"I'm certain," said the barbarian&mdash;"I'll wager
that Cedo Alteram will tan my back as a tanner
whacks a bullock's hide. It's abominable, my friend,
abominable."
</p><p>
The worthy pair were now stragglers behind the
army, because Aragaris according to his custom had
got dead drunk in a plundered village and Strombix
had been thrashed. The little Syrian had made a
fruitless attempt to obtain the favours of a handsome
Frankish girl. This sixteen-year-old-beauty, daughter
of a barbarian killed in the fight, had administered to
him two such blows that he had fallen on his back and
had then fairly stamped upon him.
</p><p>
"She wasn't a girl but a devil," declared Strombix.
"I hardly took hold of her and she nearly broke every
rib in my body."
</p><p>
The note of the trumpet became more and more distinct.
Aragaris, sniffing the wind like a blood-hound,
noticed the smell of smoke; the bivouacs must be but
a short way off.
</p><p>
The night became pitch dark. They could hardly
make out the road; the path was lost in marshes in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
which they leapt from tussock to tussock. Fog began
to rise. Suddenly from a great yew, with branches
from which moss hung like long grey beards, something
fled away with a harsh cry. Strombix crouched
down with fear. It was a black cock.
</p><p>
They finally lost their bearings. Strombix climbed
a tree.
</p><p>
"The bivouacs lie northwards&mdash;not far off. There's
a wide river below."
</p><p>
"The Rhine, the Rhine!" exclaimed Aragaris.
"Now go ahead!"
</p><p>
They slid down through the birches and aspen trees
a hundred years old.
</p><p>
"Cousin, I'm drowning!" yelled Strombix.
"Somebody's hauling me by the feet!"
</p><p>
"Where are you?"
</p><p>
With great difficulty Aragaris extricated him, and,
swearing, took him on his shoulders. Under his feet
the Sarmatian felt the stems of faggots laid down by the
Romans. This causeway of faggot work led to the
great road hewn not long before through the forest by
the army of Severus, Julian's general. The barbarians,
according to their custom, had blocked and encumbered
the track with enormous trunks of trees.
These trunks had to be clambered over. Sometimes
rotten, moss-covered, and crumbling under foot, and
sometimes hard and slippery with rain, they made the
march most difficult; and it was by roads like these,
always in fear of an attack, that the army of about
thirteen thousand men had to move. That army every
Imperial general except Severus had traitorously abandoned.
</p><p>
Strombix was cursing his comrade&mdash;
</p><p>
"I won't go a step farther, heathen! I'd rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
lie down on the dead leaves and die; at least I should
not see your damned visage&mdash;huh! Unbeliever! It's
easy to see that you don't wear the cross! Is it a
Christian's business to drag along a road like this, and
what are we pushing on to? The rods of the centurion.
I won't go a step farther."
</p><p>
Aragaris hauled him on by main force, and, when
the road became more practicable, carried shoulder-high
the whimsical companion who kept abusing and
pummelling him all the time and shortly fell soundly
asleep on those mighty pagan shoulders.
</p><p>
At midnight they reached the gates of the Roman
camp. Everything was still. The drawbridge had long
been raised. The friends had to sleep in the wood near
the hinder gate, usually called the Decumanal.
</p><p>
At dawn the trumpet sounded. The nightingale had
been singing in the misty wood; he ceased, frightened
by the warlike notes. Aragaris snuffed the smell of
soup and woke Strombix. They made their way into
the camp and sat down near the cauldrons. In the
principal tent near the Pretorian gate the Cæsar Julian
was keeping watch.
</p><p>
From the day on which he had been nominated
Cæsar at Milan thanks to the protection of the Empress
Eusebia, Julian had applied himself with zeal to
soldierly exercises. He not only used to study the art
of war under the direction of Severus, but desired
moreover to master every detail of the work of the rank
and file. Within sound of the trumpet, in barracks,
on the Campus Martius in company with new recruits,
during whole days he would learn to march, to use the
bow and sling, to leap ditches, and to run under the
heavy weight of full marching order. He became also
an adept in swordsmanship.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
</p><p>
The blood of the race of Constantine, a race of austere
and obstinate warriors, woke in the young man
and overcame his monkish hypocrisy.
</p><p>
"Alack! divine Iamblicus and Plato! if you could
only see what your pupil is becoming!" he would
sometimes exclaim, wiping the sweat from his brow.
</p><p>
And pointing to his armour he would add&mdash;
</p><p>
"Don't you think, Severus, that this steel sits as
badly on a pupil of philosophers as a war-saddle on an
ox?"
</p><p>
Severus would only reply by a mischievous smile;
he knew that these sighings and complaints were not
sincere, and that in reality Julian was delighted with
his military progress.
</p><p>
In a few months he had been so transformed and
hardened into manhood that it was not easy to recognise
in him the "little Greek" of the Court of Constantius.
His eyes alone had not changed, still shining
with a strange and unforgettable keenness which had
in it something of fever. Julian felt himself growing
stronger every day, not only physically, but morally also.
For the first time in his existence he felt the happiness
that comes from the love of simple and common folk.
</p><p>
From the first it had gratified the legionaries to see
a real Cæsar, cousin of the Augustus, learning soldiering
in barracks, with no repugnance for the coarse fare
of soldiers. Austere faces of the veterans would light
up with grim tenderness as they watched young Cæsar,
and remembering their own youth wondered at his
rapid progress. Julian used to hail them, listen to
their gossip over old campaigns, and advice about
fastening the breastplate so that the straps might chafe
less and the best way of holding the foot while marching
to avoid over-fatigue.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
</p><p>
The rumour went round that the Emperor Constantius
had sent the inexperienced young man among the
barbarians of Gaul to get killed, that he himself might
be rid of a rival. It was said that the generals, following
the hints of Imperial eunuchs, had abandoned and
betrayed the young Cæsar accordingly. All this increased
the affection of the legions for Julian.
</p><p>
Skilled in the arts of winning favour, acquired during
his monkish education, Julian cautiously used every
means to strengthen the love felt towards himself and
to deepen the unpopularity of the Emperor. Before
the soldiers he would speak of his brother Constantius
with meaning humility, lowering his eyes and affecting
the aspect of a victim. It was the easier for him to captivate
the warriors by fearlessness, inasmuch as death
in battle seemed to him a thing to be desired. The
kind of death to which Gallus had been subjected
formed no part of his designs.
</p><p>
Julian had organised his life after the austere example
of ancient conquerors. His stoic education by
the tutor Mardonius helped him to endure total absence
of comfort. He allowed himself less sleep than the
meanest soldier, and lay not on a bed but upon a coarse
rough carpet, like that called in popular parlance
<i>suburra</i>.
</p><p>
The first part of the night was devoted to sleep, the
second to the business of state and war, the third to
the Muses. For Julian's favourite books were never
left behind when he was campaigning. He inspired
himself with Marcus Aurelius, Plutarch, Suetonius,
and Cato the elder; and by day he endeavoured to put
in practice what he had mused over with them by night.
</p><p>
On the memorable morning before the battle of
Argentoratum, when he heard the <i>reveillé</i> at dawn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Julian quickly donned complete armour, and ordered
his charger to be brought round. While waiting he
withdrew into the inmost part of the tent. There was
ensconced a lovely statuette of the winged Mercury,
bearing the caduceus&mdash;the god of movement, gaiety,
success. Julian bowed before the image and threw
some grains of incense on a little tripod. According
to the direction of the smoke the Cæsar, who flattered
himself that he understood the divining art, sought to
ascertain the influence of the day. Overnight he had
heard a raven crying three times&mdash;a bad omen.
</p><p>
Julian was so convinced that his unexpected military
success in Gaul was due to some supernatural power
that from day to day he became more superstitious.
</p><p>
When issuing from the tent he stumbled over the
wooden beam at the threshold. The face of the Cæsar
darkened. All the omens were unfavourable; he inwardly
resolved to postpone the battle till the morrow.
</p><p>
The army began its march. The road through the
forest was painful. Masses of trees embarrassed every
step. The day promised to be a very hot one. The
army had only done half its journey, and there remained
more than one and twenty Roman miles to
cover to reach the camp of the German barbarians
(Alemanni) which lay on the left bank of the Rhine
in a great plain, near the town Argentoratum.
</p><p>
The soldiers were worn out. As soon as they had
crossed the forest and reached open ground Julian assembled
them round himself in a great circle, like
spectators in an amphitheatre, so as himself to be the
centre of the centurions and cohorts, extending from
him like the spokes of a huge wheel. This was the
custom of the Roman army, so that the greatest possible
number could hear the words of their general.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian explained to the legions in a few brief and
simple sentences that fatigue might prevent success,
that it would be safer to camp for that night in the
field where they were, to rest, and attack the barbarians
the following morning, with vigour renewed.
</p><p>
Discontented murmurs ran through the army; the
rank and file struck their shields with lances&mdash;a sign
of impatience&mdash;clamouring that Julian should lead
them without delay to the field of battle. The Cæsar
understood by the general expression on faces around
him that in resisting he would commit a grave mistake.
He felt in the crowd that thrill of ferocity with
which he was so familiar, which was so indispensable
to victory, and by the least maladroitness so easily to
be changed into mutiny. He leapt on horseback and
gave the signal to continue the march. Peals of enthusiasm
answered him and the army moved off.
</p><p>
When the sun was beginning to sink they reached
the plain of Argentoratum. There the Rhine was
shining between low hills. To the south rose the sombre
mass of the Vosges Mountains, and swallows were
sweeping over the surface of the majestic German river.
</p><p>
Suddenly, on the nearest hill, three riders appeared;
they were the Alemanni.
</p><p>
The Romans halted, and disposed themselves in
battle-order. Julian, surrounded by six hundred steel-clad
horsemen, the Clibanarii, commanded the horsemen
of the right wing. On the left extended the infantry,
under the orders of Severus. Julian himself was also
under the command of this general.
</p><p>
The barbarians opposed their cavalry to that of
Julian. At their head rode the Alemannic king Chlodomir.
Fronting Severus, Agenaric, the young nephew
of Chlodomir, led the German infantry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
</p><p>
War-horns, trumpets, and fifes resounded; ensigns
and flags inscribed with the names of cohorts, the
purple dragons and Roman eagles, assembled at the
head of the legions. In the van strode axe-bearers,
chief centurions, and <i>primipilares</i>, men bred to victory.
Their regular and heavy tread shook the earth. Suddenly
the foot soldiers of Severus halted. The barbarians,
who had been lurking in a trench, sprang from
their ambuscade and attacked the Romans. Julian
from a distance saw the confusion that ensued and
galloped up to restore order. He attempted to calm
the soldiers, speaking hastily now to one cohort, now
to another, in something of the concise style of Julius
Cæsar. When he uttered the words, "<i>Exurgamus
viri fortes</i>" or "<i>Advenit, socii, justem pugnandi jam
tempus,</i>" this young man of twenty-two was thinking
with pride: "At last I am like such and such a famous
soldier!" Even in the very fire of action he never forgot
his books, and rejoiced to enact over again familiar
scenes of Livy, Plutarch, and Sallust. The well-tried
Severus restrained his ardour, and, while giving a certain
liberty to Julian, retained the general direction of
the action. Arrows whizzed and barbarian javelins,
dragging long cords; and war-engines flung huge
stones hundreds of yards.
</p><p>
The Romans now found themselves face to face at
last with the terrible and mysterious inhabitants of the
North, about whom so many incredible legends were
afloat. Some wore bear-skins on their backs, and on
their shaggy heads the gaping jaws of wolves. Others
had their helms adorned with the horns of stag and
bull. The Alemanni were so contemptuous of death
that, keeping only lance and sword, they frequently
flung themselves into battle stark naked.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
</p><p>
Their reddish hair was knotted on the top of their
heads and fell back on the neck in a thick mass or
plaited mane. They wore long sweeping broad moustaches
and their skins were deeply bronzed. A great
number were so savage that, unfamiliar with the use
of steel, they fought with bone-tipped lances dipped in
violent poison. A scratch from this primitive barb
was sufficient to produce a slow death in terrible agony.
From head to foot, instead of armour they wore thin
scales pared from the hoofs of horses and sewn on linen,
a kind of horny mail. In this array the barbarians
seemed strange monsters, clad in birds' feathers and
fish scales.
</p><p>
There were also Saxons with pale blue eyes, men for
whom the sea had no terrors, but who feared the land.
</p><p>
The foremost <i>primipilares</i>, locking their shields together,
formed a compact wall of steel, and advanced
steadily, slowly, almost invulnerable to blows. The
Alemanni rushed upon this wall with ferocious cries,
like the hoarse growls of bears. The main fight began,
breast against breast, shield against shield. Dust was
so thick over the plain that the sun was darkened.
At this moment on the right wing the iron-clad horses
of the Clibanarii began rearing and taking fright.
The stampede threatened to crush the legions of the
rearguard. Through the cloud of arrows and lances,
the fire-coloured scarf of the gigantic king Chlodomir
was shining in bright sunlight.
</p><p>
Julian in the nick of time galloped up on his black
charger, bespattered with foam. He grasped the situation.
The barbarian foot-soldiers, placed for the purpose
between their horsemen, were slipping under the
legs of the Roman horses, and disembowelling them; the
horses fell, dragging down in their fall the <i>cataphracti</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
or men in scale-armour, who, overwhelmed under
its weight, were unable to rise. Julian placed himself
directly behind the flying horsemen; it was a question
of either stemming the flight or being crushed himself.
The tribune of the Clibanarii came into collision with
him. Pale with shame and terror, he recognised
Julian. Julian's forehead flushed purple, he forgot his
classical books, leaned over, seized the flying man by
the throat, and shouted with a voice which appeared to
himself strangely savage&mdash;
</p><p>
"Coward!"
</p><p>
Then he faced the tribune round to the enemy. The
<i>cataphracti</i> halted, glanced at the purple dragon, the
Imperial ensign, and remained motionless. In a moment
the mass of iron recoiled and swept back anew
against the barbarians. The fight became a wild confusion.
A lance struck Julian full in the breast; he
owed his safety to his breastplate. An arrow hissed
by his ear, grazing his cheek with its feathers. Severus
now sent the legions of the Cornuti and Brakathi, half-savage
allies of the Romans, to succour the wavering
cavalry. They were wont to sing their war-hymn, the
Barrith, only when their blood was up in the joy of
battle, intoning it in a low and plaintive voice. The
first notes were calm as the nocturnal sighing of woods;
but little by little the Barrith became louder, more
solemn, and terrible, until at last, raising a furious and
deafening roar like a stormy sea, all the singers were
beside themselves.
</p><p>
Julian ceased to see or understand the surge of battle
round him; he was conscious only of intolerable thirst
and a sharp aching in the bones of his sword hand; he
had lost all reckoning of time. But Severus kept all
his presence of mind, and directed the fight with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
incomparable skill. Perplexed and heart-broken, Julian
perceived the orange scarf of Chlodomir in the midst
of the legions; the barbarians had penetrated obliquely
into the centre of the Roman army. Julian thought
"All is lost!" He remembered the unfavourable
presages of the morning and addressed a last prayer to
the gods of Olympus&mdash;
</p><p>
"Come, help me! For who is there but I to restore
you to power upon earth?"
</p><p>
In the centre of the army were stationed the old
veterans of the Petulant legion, so called on account of
their rashness. Severus counted on them, and his
reliance was not in vain. One of them shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Viri fortissimi!</i> Bravest of the brave, let us not
betray Rome and our Cæsar! Let us die for Julian!
Glory and prosperity to Cæsar Julian!"
</p><p>
"For Rome ... for Rome..." stern voices responded,
and these tried legions, grown grey under the
flag, once again went to meet death, steady and cheery.
The inspiring breath of great Rome swept over the
whole army.
</p><p>
Julian, his eyes full of enthusiastic tears, rode towards
the veterans to die along with them. Again he
felt the force of sheer affection, the force of the people
lifting him on its wings to carry him to victory.
</p><p>
Then terror seized the barbaric masses; they
trembled, broke, and fled; and the eagles of the
legions, their rapacious beaks and outspread wings
glittering in the sun, swooped down again amongst
the routed tribes, proclaiming the victory of the Eternal
City.
</p><p>
The Alemanni and Franks perished fighting to the
last gasp.
</p><p>
Kneeling in a pool of blood, the savage would wield
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
his sword or lance with a slackening hand, but in his
troubled eyes were to be seen neither fear nor despair,
only thirst for vengeance and contempt for his conquerors.
Even those who were left for dead arose,
half-crushed, and fixed their teeth in the legs of their
enemies. Six thousand barbarians fell in that battle
or were drowned in the Rhine.
</p><p>
The same evening, as Julian Cæsar stood on the hill,
enveloped by the rays of the setting sun, King Chlodomir,
who had been made prisoner on the bank of the
river, was led before him. He was breathing with
difficulty, his face livid and sweating, his enormous
hands bound behind his back. He knelt down before
his conqueror, and the young Cæsar of twenty-two
laid his slight hand upon the shaggy head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIX</h2>

<p>It was the time of vintage; all day songs had been
echoing along the hill-sides around the pleasant
Gulf of Naples.
</p><p>
In the favourite country of the Romans, at Baiæ,
famous for its sulphur-baths, Baiæ of which the Augustan
poets used to say,</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Nullus in orbe sinus Baiis prælucet am&oelig;nis,&mdash;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>idle folk were delighting in the country and Nature;
there fairer and more voluptuous than man.
</p><p>
It was an inviolate corner of that charming country,
where the imaginations of Horace, Propertius, and
Tibullus lingered yet. Not a single shadow of the
monkish age had yet dulled that sunny littoral between
Vesuvius and Cape Misenum. Christianity it is true
was not denied there; but it was smilingly put by.
Feminine sinners there were not yet repentant. On
the contrary honest women grew shy of virtue as old-fashioned.
When news of the Sibyl's prophecies
arrived, menacing the decrepit world with earthquake,
or when came news of fresh crimes and bigotries of
Constantius, or of Persians invading the East, or barbarians
threatening the North, the lucky inhabitants
of Baiæ, closing their eyes, inhaled their delicious
breeze full of the odour of Falernian half-crushed in
the wine-press, and consoled themselves with an epigram.
To forget the misfortunes of Rome and soothsay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
about the end of the world, all that they needed was
to send each other gifts of pretty verses&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Calet unda, friget æthra,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Simul innatat choreis</i>
</p><p>
<i>Amathusium renidens</i>
</p><p>
<i>Salis arbitræ et vaporis,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Flos siderum Dione!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the faces of the gayest Epicureans could be seen
something at once senile and puerile. Neither the
fresh salt water of the sea bath nor the warm sulphurous
springs of Baiæ could completely cure the bodies
of these withered and chilly young men, bald and old
at twenty, not through their own debauches, but
through sins of their ancestors; youths on whom
women, wisdom, and literature had begun to pall;
witty and impotent young men, in whose veins ran the
blood of too late a generation.
</p><p>
In one of the most flowery and pleasant nooks between
Baiæ and Puteoli and under the dark slopes of
the Apennine, rose the white marble walls of a villa.
</p><p>
Near the wide window, opening directly on the sea,
so that from the chamber sky and sea alone were visible,
Myrrha was lying on a bed.
</p><p>
The doctors had not understood her malady; but
Arsinoë, who watched her sister day by day losing
strength and vitality, had brought her from Rome to
the sea-coast.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding her illness Myrrha would clean and
arrange her chamber with her own hands, in imitation
of nuns and hermits; and would herself bring water,
and attempt to wash linen, and do her own cookery.
For weeks, and to the very last stage of her illness, she
obstinately refused to go to bed, spending whole nights
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
in prayer. One day the terrified Arsinoë found a hair-shirt
on the weak body of her sister. Myrrha had
taken all articles of luxury from her little chamber,
stripping it of curtains and ornaments, and leaving
nothing but a bed and a coarse wooden crucifix. The
bare-walled room was "her cell." She also fasted
strictly and Arsinoë found it difficult to oppose the
gentle obstinacy of her will.
</p><p>
From the life of Arsinoë all listlessness had disappeared.
She wavered continually between hope of
restoring Myrrha to health and despair at losing her.
And although she could not love her sister more passionately
than before, yet, dominated by the fear of
their eternal separation, she understood her own love
more clearly.
</p><p>
Sometimes, with motherly pity, Arsinoë would gaze
upon that wasted face, and the little body in which so
fierce a fire was burning. When the sick girl refused
wine and food prescribed by the physician, Arsinoë
would say in vexation&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do you think I am blind, Myrrha? Are you trying
to kill yourself?"
</p><p>
"Are not life and death equal in our eyes?" answered
the young girl, with such earnestness that
Arsinoë could only reply&mdash;
</p><p>
"You do not love me!..."
</p><p>
But Myrrha used to say caressingly&mdash;
</p><p>
"Beloved, you do not know how much I love you!
Oh, if you could only..."
</p><p>
The invalid would never finish the sentence, nor ask
her sister if she held the faith. But in her sad glance
at Arsinoë, as if not daring utterance, Arsinoë read reproach.
Nevertheless, she was herself unwilling to
speak about that faith, not having the courage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
communicate her doubt, for fear of perhaps robbing
her sister of the mad hope of immortality.
</p><p>
Myrrha weakened from day to day, waning like the
wax of a taper; but from day to day grew more joyous
and more calm.
</p><p>
Juventinus, who had quitted Rome lest his mother
should follow him, was waiting at Naples with Didimus
for the departure of the ship for Alexandria. He
came to see the sisters every evening. He used to read
aloud the Gospels and tell legends of the saints....
Oh, how Myrrha longed to journey to those dark caves
and live near those great and holy lives! The desert
to her appeared not dull and sterile, but flowery, a
wondrous earthly paradise, lighted by a light such as
shone on no other region. Indoors she grew stifled;
and sometimes, fevered by the pains of sickness, and
languishing after the Thebaïd, she used to watch the
white sails of ships disappear in the distance and
stretch out her pale hands towards them. Oh, to flee
after them and breathe the pure air and silence of the
desert! Many a time she would try to rise, declaring
she felt better, would soon be well, and in secret
kept hoping that they would allow her to set sail
with Didimus and Juventinus, on the ship for
Alexandria.
</p><p>
Anatolius, Arsinoë's faithful admirer, was also living
at Baiæ. The young Epicurean used to organise delightful
excursions in his gilded galley from the Bay to
the Pæstan Gulf, with gay companions and pretty
women. What he loved most was to see the purple
sails bowing over the sleepy sea; hues of twilight melting
on the cliffs of Capreæ and Ischia, looking like enormous
amethysts lying in the water. It pleased him to
ridicule his friends about their faith. The fragrance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
wines and the intoxicating kisses of courtesans pleased
him also.
</p><p>
But every time he went into Myrrha's quiet little cell
he would become aware that another side of life also
lay open to him. The innocent grace and the pale
countenance of the young girl touched him deeply.
He longed to believe in anything in which she believed:
the gentle Galilean, and the miracle of immortality.
He would listen to the tales of Juventinus, and the
life of desert anchorites he, too, thought sublime.
Anatolius observed with surprise that for himself
truth existed both in the intoxication of life and in its
renunciation; both in the triumph of matter and in the
triumph of soul; both in chastity and in voluptuousness.
His intelligence remained clear, and his conscience
without remorse.
</p><p>
Even doubt had for him its pleasure, like a kind of
new game. These deep and gentle waves of opinion,
transitions from Christianity to Paganism, lulled his
soul rather than distressed it.
</p><p>
One evening Myrrha fell asleep before the open window.
On awakening, she said to Juventinus with a
bright smile&mdash;
</p><p>
"I've had a strange dream...."
</p><p>
"What was it?"
</p><p>
"I don't remember. But it was happy. Do you
think that the whole world will gain salvation?"
</p><p>
"All the righteous; sinners will be punished."
</p><p>
"Righteous? sinners?... That is not my idea,"
answered Myrrha, still smiling, as if she was trying to
remember the dream. "Do you know, Juventinus,
that all, all shall be saved, and that God will not suffer
one to be lost!"
</p><p>
"So the great master Origen believed. He used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
say, 'My Saviour cannot rejoice so long as I am in iniquity.'
But that is a heresy...."
</p><p>
Myrrha, not listening, went on&mdash;
</p><p>
"Yes! yes! that must be so. I understand it at last.
All shall be saved, to the very last. God will not allow
one of His creatures to perish."
</p><p>
"I wish I too could believe it," murmured Juventinus,
"but I should be afraid...."
</p><p>
"One must fear nothing; where there is love, fear is
cast out. I do not fear anything."
</p><p>
"And He?" demanded Juventinus.
</p><p>
"Who?"
</p><p>
"He, the Unnameable, the Arch-rebel!"
</p><p>
"He also, He also!" cried Myrrha, with strong conviction.
"So long as there shall be even a soul that
has not gained salvation, no creature can enjoy full
felicity. If there be no bounds to Love, if Love is infinite,
then all shall be in God, and God in all. Friend,
will not that be happiness? We have not yet taken
full account of that. Every soul must be blessed, do
you understand?"
</p><p>
"And Evil?"
</p><p>
"There is no evil, if there is no Death."
</p><p>
Through the open window came the echo of the Bacchic
songs of the friends of Anatolius, making merry
in their purple galleys on the blue twilight sea.
</p><p>
Myrrha pointed to them&mdash;
</p><p>
"And that is also beautiful, and that is also to be
blest," she murmured.
</p><p>
"What? These vicious songs?" asked Juventinus,
dreading her reply.
</p><p>
Myrrha shook her head&mdash;
</p><p>
"No! all is well, all is pure. Beauty comes from God.
Friend, what are you afraid of? To love, one must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
be unspeakably free!... Fear absolutely nothing.
You are still ignorant what happiness life can give!"
</p><p>
She drew a deep sigh and added&mdash;
</p><p>
"And what happiness death gives too!"
</p><p>
It was their last talk together. Myrrha lay in bed
for several days, motionless and silent, without opening
her eyes. She may have suffered much, for her brows
would sometimes contract with pain; but a gentle smile
of resignation would follow; not a groan, not a complaint
escaped the closed lips.
</p><p>
Once, at midnight, she called Arsinoë, who was sitting
beside her. The sick girl spoke with difficulty;
she asked, without opening her eyes&mdash;
</p><p>
"Is it yet day?"
</p><p>
"No, night still," answered Arsinoë, "but the sun
will soon rise."
</p><p>
"I cannot hear.... Who are you?" Myrrha
murmured indistinctly.
</p><p>
"It is I, Arsinoë."
</p><p>
The invalid suddenly opened her wide luminous eyes
and gazed fixedly on her sister.
</p><p>
"It seemed to me," said Myrrha with an effort, "it
seemed to me that it was not you ... that I was utterly
alone."
</p><p>
Then very slowly, with great difficulty, being
scarcely able to move, she brought her transparent
hands together, with an imploring look of fear. The
corners of the lips trembled, the eyebrows moved.
</p><p>
"Do not abandon me! When I die, do not think
that I am no more!"
</p><p>
Arsinoë leaned towards her, but Myrrha was too
weak to kiss her, although she tried to do so. Arsinoë
brought her cheek closer to the great eyes, and the
young girl softly caressed her face with the long lashes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Arsinoë felt on her cheek a touch light as butterfly's
velvety wings. It was a trick invented by Myrrha in
childhood.
</p><p>
That last caress brought back to Arsinoë all their
life together, all their mutual affection. She fell on her
knees and, for the first time for years, sobbed irresistibly,
as if the tears were melting her inmost heart.
</p><p>
"No, Myrrha," she said, "I will not abandon you....
I will stay with you always!"
</p><p>
Myrrha's eyes grew animated and joyous; she faltered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Then you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Yes; I long to believe; <i>I will believe!</i>" exclaimed
Arsinoë, and immediately wondered. Those words appeared
a miracle to herself, and no deception. She had
no wish to recall them.
</p><p>
"I will go into the desert, Myrrha; like you, instead
of you," she continued in a transport of wild love;
"and, if God exists, He must grant that there shall be
no death between us; so that we <i>shall</i> be always
together."
</p><p>
Myrrha closed her eyes, listening to her sister. With
a smile of infinite peace, she murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now, I will go to sleep. I want nothing more. I
am well."
</p><p>
She never opened her eyes or spoke again; her face
was calm and severe as the face of the dead; and in
this state she lived on several days longer.
</p><p>
When a cup of wine was brought near to her lips,
she would swallow a few mouthfuls. If her breathing
became nervous and irregular, Juventinus would chant
a prayer or some divine hymn, and then, as if soothed,
Myrrha began to breathe more easily.
</p><p>
One evening, when the sun had set behind Ischia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and Capreæ, while the motionless sea was melting into
heaven, and the first dim star trembling, Juventinus
was singing to the dying girl&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p><i>Deus creator omnium</i>
</p><p>
<i>Polique rector vestiens,</i>
</p><p>
<i>Diem decore lumine</i>
</p><p>
<i>Noctem sopora gratia.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perhaps Myrrha's last sigh was breathed to the
sound of that solemn hymn. None knew when she
died. There seemed no change. Her life mingled
painlessly with the impalpable, inviolable, the Eternal,
as the warmth of a fair twilight melts into the coolness
of night.
</p><p>
Arsinoë buried her sister in the catacombs, and with
her own hand engraved on the slab, "<i>Myrrha, vivis!</i>"
("Myrrha, thou livest.")
</p><p>
She scarcely wept. But she bore in her heart contempt
for the world, and the resolve to believe in God,
or at least to do all she could to attain belief in Him.
She desired to distribute her fortune to the poor, and
to set out for the Thebaïd. On the very day Arsinoë
informed her indignant guardian of these intentions
she received from Gaul a curt and enigmatic letter from
Cæsar Julian&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian, to the most noble Arsinoë, happiness! Do
you remember the matter about which we spoke together
at Athens, in front of the statue of Artemis? Do
you remember our alliance? Great is my hate, but
greater yet is my love. It may be that the lion shall
fling away the ass's skin soon. Meantime, let us be
gentle as doves and wise as serpents, according to the
counsel of the Nazarean Christ."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XX</h2>

<p>Composers of Court epigrams, who mockingly
nicknamed Julian "Victorinus" or "the little
Conqueror," were astonished to receive, time after
time, news of the Cæsar's continual victories. The
laughable gradually became the terrible. General discussion
arose about witchcrafts and secret dæmonic
forces backing the fortunes of the friend of Maximus of
Ephesus.
</p><p>
Julian had conquered and restored to the Roman
Empire Argentoratum, Bracomagum,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
Tres Tabernæ,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
Noviomagus,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>

Moguntiacum.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
</p><p>
The soldiers worshipped him as much as ever; and
Julian became more and more convinced that the Olympians
were protecting him and advancing his cause.
But, for prudential reasons, he continued to attend
Christian churches, and in the town of Vienna on the
banks of the river Rhodanus he had been present at
an especially solemn mass.
</p><p>
In the middle of December the conquering Cæsar
was returning after a long campaign to winter quarters
in his beloved Parisis-Lutetia on the banks of the
Seine.
</p><p>
Night was closing in. The southern soldiers were
marvelling at the pale green lights of the northern sky.
New-fallen snow sounded crisply under the tread of
the soldiers. Lutetia, built on a little island, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
surrounded by wide river-channels. Two wooden bridges
connected the town with steep banks. Its houses were
built in the Gallo-Roman style, with broad glazed galleries,
instead of the open porticoes of southern countries.
The smoke of a multitude of chimneys hung
over the town, and the trees were hoar with frost.
</p><p>
Fig-trees carefully swaddled in straw, and brought
by the Romans from the south, clung to the southward-facing
walls of the gardens, like children dreading the
cold.
</p><p>
This year, in spite of occasional thawing winds from
the south, the winter had been severe. Huge blocks
of ice, crashing and grinding together, were floating
down the Seine. The Greek and Roman soldiers used to
watch these in surprise, and Julian too wondered at the
beauty of the blue and green transparent masses, and
compared them to Phrygian marble, with its emerald-hued
veins.
</p><p>
There was something in the sad beauty of the North
which, like a distant remembrance, haunted and
thrilled his heart, as now he and his troop arrived at
the palace, of which the brick arcades and turrets rose
in sharp black outline against the twilight sky.
</p><p>
Julian went into the library. The cold was intense;
a great fire was kindled on the hearth, and letters which
had arrived at Lutetia during his absence were brought
to him. One of these from Asia Minor came from
Iamblicus. Julian thought that the fragrance of the
East came with it.
</p><p>
Outside a hurricane was raging, and the wind roaring
by struck violent blows on the closed shutters.
Shutting his eyes, Julian dreamed of marble porticoes
and gleaming temples veiled in obscurity, sweeping
away to the horizon to disappear like golden clouds.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
</p><p>
He shivered, rose, and noticed that the fire had gone
out. He could hear a mouse gnawing the parchments
in the library.
</p><p>
Julian suddenly felt a longing to see a human face.
With a half-humorous smile he remembered that he
had a wife. She was a relative of the Empress Eusebia,
named Helena, whom the Emperor had forced to marry
Julian shortly before his departure for Gaul. Julian
cared nothing for Helena. Although more than a year
had elapsed since their marriage he had scarcely seen
her; he knew nothing of her, and had never passed a
night under the same roof. His wife had remained a
virgin.
</p><p>
From youth up, her dream had been to become the
spouse of Christ. The idea of marriage filled her with
disgust. At first she had thought all was lost, but,
seeing afterwards that Julian asked from her no conjugal
caresses, she grew calmer and lived in her apartment,
morose, placid, dressed in black, the life of a
nun. In her prayers Helena had vowed perpetual
chastity.
</p><p>
On this night a mischievous curiosity drove Julian to
the tower in which his wife was praying. He opened
the door without knocking, and went into the feebly
lighted cell; the virgin was kneeling before a lectern
above which hung a large crucifix.
</p><p>
Julian approached, and screening the flame of the
lamp with one hand, gazed at his wife for some minutes,
frowning. She was so absorbed in devotion that
she did not notice him. He said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Helena!"
</p><p>
She uttered a cry and turned her pale severe face
towards Julian.
</p><p>
"How you startled me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
</p><p>
He looked wonderingly at the great crucifix, the
gospel, and the lectern, and murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Are you always praying?"
</p><p>
"Yes! I pray for you also, well-beloved Cæsar."
</p><p>
"For me? Really!... Confess that you believe
me to be a great sinner?"
</p><p>
She lowered her eyes without answering. His frown
became deeper.
</p><p>
"Do not be afraid; speak out. Don't you believe that
I am specially guilty, in some manner, before God?"
</p><p>
She answered in a low voice&mdash;
</p><p>
"Specially?... Yes, I think so. Do not be
angry...."
</p><p>
"I was sure of it.... Now tell me what it is? I
must repent me of my crimes."
</p><p>
Helena resumed, in a yet lower voice, and more
severely&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do not laugh! I have to answer for your soul before
the Eternal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"You ... for mine?"
</p><p>
"We are joined for ever."
</p><p>
"By what?"
</p><p>
"The sacrament of marriage."
</p><p>
"Religious marriage? But up till now we are
strangers to one another, Helena!"
</p><p>
"I fear for your soul, Julian," she repeated, fixing
on him her innocent eyes.
</p><p>
Placing his hand on her shoulder, he gazed mockingly
at the pale face, so cold in its chastity. The
small and lovely mouth, with its rosy lips half parted
with an expression of fear and inquiry, was in strange
contrast to the rest of the face. Julian leaned towards
her, and before she had time to regain her presence of
mind, kissed her on the lips.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
</p><p>
She started and rushed to a far corner of the room,
hiding her face in her hands. Then gazing at Julian,
her eyes wild with fear, she hastily crossed herself,
murmuring&mdash;
</p><p>
"Away, away, O evil one! I know thee; thou art
not Julian, but the Devil. In the name of the most
Holy Cross, I conjure thee ... disappear!"
</p><p>
Anger seized Julian; he turned to the door and
bolted it; then approaching Helena with a smile he
said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Be yourself, Helena; I am a man&mdash;I am your husband&mdash;and
not the Devil! The Church has blessed our
union." He gazed upon her with strangely warring
emotions. She slowly drew her hands from her eyes.
</p><p>
"Forgive me ... it seemed to me ... you frightened
me so, Julian.... I know that you desire
nothing evil ... but I have had visions.... Just
now I believed.... He haunts this place at night.
Twice I have seen him.... He said to me ill things
about you. Since then I have been afraid. He told
me you bore on your face the mark of Cain.... Why
do you look at me so, Julian?"
</p><p>
She was trembling and leaning against the wall; he
approached and put his arm round her waist.
</p><p>
"What are you doing? Let me go, let me go!"
</p><p>
She tried to cry out, to call the servant.
</p><p>
"Eleutheria! Eleutheria!"
</p><p>
"Why are you calling? Am I not your husband?"
</p><p>
She began to weep bitterly.
</p><p>
"Brother, this must not be.... I am the bride of
Christ!... I believed that you...."
</p><p>
"The bride of the Roman Cæsar cannot be the bride
of Christ!"
</p><p>
"Julian!... If you believe in Him...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
</p><p>
He smiled.
</p><p>
"I abhor the Galilean!"
</p><p>
In a supreme effort she strove to repulse him, exclaiming,
"Away, Devil!... Why hast thou abandoned
me, Lord?"
</p><p>
With his impious hands he tore off the black vestment.
His soul was full of fear, but never before in
his life had he known such intoxication in evil-doing.
Ironically, with a smile of defiance, the Roman Cæsar
gazed at the opposite corner of the cell, where in the
feeble flicker of the lamp-light hung the great black
crucifix....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XXI</h2>

<p>More than two years had elapsed since the victory
of Argentoratum. Julian had delivered Gaul
from the barbarians. At the beginning of spring, when
still at Lutetia for his winter quarters, he had received
an important letter from the Emperor Constantius
brought by the tribune Decensius.
</p><p>
Each new victory achieved in Gaul harried the soul
of Constantius, and stabbed his vanity to the quick.
This "street-urchin," this "magpie," this "monkey
in the purple," this "pocket conqueror," to the indignation
of Court scoffers had turned into a veritable
victor.
</p><p>
Constantius writhed with jealousy. At the same
time he sustained defeat after defeat in his own campaign
against the Persians in the Asiatic provinces.
He grew thin, sleepless, lost his appetite, and twice
suffered from terrible attacks of vomiting. The Court
physicians were in dismay.
</p><p>
Sometimes, during nights of insomnia, lying in bed
under the sacred standard of Constantine, the Emperor
mused:
</p><p>
"Eusebia deceived me! But for her I should have
followed the wise counsel of Mercurius.... I should
have had his throat cut in some dark corner! I
should have exterminated this serpent from the Flavian
nest!... Imbecile that I was!... It was I,
myself, who let him escape! And who knows?...
Perhaps Eusebia herself was his mistress?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
</p><p>
A long-delayed jealousy made his envy bitterer still.
He could not revenge himself on the Empress Eusebia,
who was dead. His second wife, Faustine, was an
empty-headed little woman for whom he felt nothing
but contempt.
</p><p>
Constantius tore the hair on which hairdressers still
spent such infinite pains, and shed tears of rage. Had
he not protected the Church? Had he not swept all
heresies to destruction? Had he not built and adorned
monastery after monastery? Did he not regularly
accomplish all due rites and offices? And now what
reward was granted him? For the first time the master
of the world felt his soul swelling in indignation
against the Master of the universe. A dark imprecation
rose to his lips.
</p><p>
To assuage his jealousy he had recourse to unusual
means. He sent letters to all great cities,&mdash;"letters of
victory," adorned with laurels, and announcing the
triumphs granted by the grace of God to the Emperor
Constantius. These letters were to the effect that it
was Constantius and not Julian who had four times
crossed the Rhine,&mdash;Constantius (who was really frittering
away his army at the other end of the world).
It was Constantius, and not Julian, who had almost
perished from arrows at Argentoratum! Constantius
who had taken Chlodomir prisoner; Constantius who
had pierced marshes and impracticable forests, hewn
roads, stormed fortresses and endured hunger, thirst,
heat; who, more wearied than the soldiers, had allotted
to himself less sleep than they.
</p><p>
Julian's name was never mentioned in these despatches,
as if that Cæsar were no longer in existence.
The people applauded Constantius as conqueror of the
Gauls, and in all the churches, bishops and archbishops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
chanted prayers and thanksgivings for victory granted
to him over the barbaric Alemanni.
</p><p>
Julian on hearing of these follies contented himself
with a smile. But the Emperor's gnawing jealousy
was not sated. He decided to rob Julian of his best
soldiers, and then by imperceptible steps and fleeting
pretences to disarm him, as Gallus had been disarmed;
to draw him into the toils and deal him the mortal
blow.
</p><p>
With this intention he sent with a letter to Lutetia a
certain skilful official, the tribune Decensius. He was
forthwith to select the most trusted legions, namely,
the Heruli, Batavians, Petulants, and Celts; and to
despatch them into Asia for the Emperor's own use.
Moreover, this dignitary was to deflower each remaining
legion of its three hundred bravest warriors; and
Cintula, tribune of the Imperial stables, was instructed
to take the pick of the porters and baggage-carriers,
and, having thus crippled Julian's transport, to bring
these men to the East.
</p><p>
Julian warned Decensius, and proved to him that rebellion
was inevitable among the savage legions raised
in Gaul, who would almost certainly prefer to die
rather than quit their native soil. But that obstinate
official, preserving an imperturbable haughtiness on
his wily yellow face, took no account of these observations.
</p><p>
At right angles to one of the wooden bridges which
joined the island of Lutetia to the river-banks, stretched
long, low barrack buildings. All the morning the soldiery
had been excited and tumultuous. The stern
and wise discipline hitherto observed by Julian alone
restrained them.
</p><p>
The first cohorts of Petulants and the Heruli had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
departed on the previous night. Their comrades the
Celts and Batavians were preparing to follow them.
Cintula issued his orders in a peremptory tone. Savage
murmurs were running through the crowd. An insubordinate
soldier had just been beaten to death. Decensius
strode hither and thither, pen behind ear,
documents in hand. In the great courtyards, under a
dark sky, thick-wheeled covered chariots were waiting
for the soldiers' wives and children. Women, parting
from the country where they were born, were stretching
out their arms to the woods and fields. Others
were kissing the maternal soil, and weeping at the
thought that their dust should be buried in a strange
land. Others, more resigned and sullen in their pain,
had wrapped handfuls of earth in little bundles, to
carry with them as tokens. A lean dog, with ribs to
be counted through his skin, was licking the grease of
an axle-tree. Suddenly he darted away and began to
howl, muzzle in the dust. Everybody, thrilled by the
sound, turned round to watch him. A legionary angrily
thrashed the poor beast, who fled into a field with
his tail between his legs, and, halting there, renewed
his howlings in a yet more plaintive key. This dog's
cry, wailing through the impressive silence of the twilight,
shook the nerves of all who heard it. The Sarmatian
Aragaris belonged to the number chosen to
leave the north. He was bidding farewell to the faithful
Strombix&mdash;
</p><p>
"Oh, cousin, cousin! why are you leaving me?"
whined Strombix, between mouthfuls of soup, which
Aragaris had given up to him. Grief had taken away
his own appetite.
</p><p>
"Be quiet, fool!" the consolatory Aragaris was
remarking; "there are too many women groaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
already!... It would be more useful if you, who
belong to the country, would tell me what forests we
shall have to pass through?"
</p><p>
"What do you mean, cousin? There are no forests
there; only sand and rocks."
</p><p>
"And how does one get shelter from the sun?"
asked the incredulous Aragaris.
</p><p>
"It's a desert! It's as hot there as under a cook's
oven, and there's not a drop of water."
</p><p>
"What! No water? And how about beer?"
</p><p>
"They don't even know what beer means!"
</p><p>
"You're lying!"
</p><p>
"May I be struck blind, cousin, if in all Mesopotamia
and Syria you find a keg of beer or of honey."
</p><p>
"Then it's all over, brother! If it's hot there, and
there's neither water, beer, nor honey, they're simply
hunting us to the end of the world like oxen to the
slaughter!"
</p><p>
"Hunting you on to the horns of the Devil,
cousin!" and Strombix wept yet more bitterly.
</p><p>
At that moment there came a distant rumble, and din
of voices. The two friends ran out of the barracks; a
crowd of soldiers were rushing over the wooden bridge
towards Lutetia. The cries came nearer; wild agitation
seized the garrison; the soldiery poured out upon
the road in a dense shouting mass, in spite of the orders,
threats, and even blows of the centurions.
</p><p>
"What has happened?" asked a veteran.
</p><p>
"Twenty soldiers have been beaten to death!"
</p><p>
"What? Twenty! Why, it was a hundred!"
</p><p>
"They're going to cudgel every man in turn; it's
the order!"
</p><p>
Suddenly a legionary with torn clothes and terrified
demeanour rushed into the crowd shouting&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
</p><p>
"Comrades! quick, to the palace!... quick!
Julian's just been beheaded!"
</p><p>
These words fell like a spark on tinder. The long-smouldering
flame burst into destructiveness. The faces
of the soldiers took on an expression of animal ferocity.
No one understood nor wished to hear, but all shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Where are the rascals? Kill the hounds!"
</p><p>
"Who?"
</p><p>
"The envoys from the Emperor Constantius!"
</p><p>
"Down with the Emperor!"
</p><p>
"Ah, the idiots!&mdash;to think they've killed such a
leader!"
</p><p>
Two innocent centurions who were passing were
seized, thrown to earth, trampled upon and almost
rent in pieces. At the sight of the gushing blood the
mutineers became yet more ferocious. Another mob
coming over the bridge swept up to the barracks, and
there rose a deafening cry&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory to the Emperor Julian! Glory to Augustus
Julian!"
</p><p>
"He is slain! He is slain!"
</p><p>
"Hold your peace, fools; Augustus is alive! We've
just seen him!"
</p><p>
"The Cæsar's alive!"
</p><p>
"He's no longer Cæsar, but Emperor!"
</p><p>
"Who said he was killed?"
</p><p>
"Where is the blackguard?"
</p><p>
"They tried to kill him!"
</p><p>
"Who?"
</p><p>
"Constantius!"
</p><p>
"Down with Constantius! Down with all cursed
eunuchs!"
</p><p>
Someone on horseback rode by so quickly as almost
to escape recognition&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
</p><p>
"Decensius! Decensius! Catch the ruffian!"
</p><p>
Still with pen behind his ear and ink-flask dangling
from his girdle, accompanied by insults and laughter,
he disappeared from sight. The crowd grew thicker
and thicker, and the mutinous army was like a raging
flood; but their anger was turned into glee when the
Herulian and Petulant legions, who had marched
the evening before, and also mutinied, were seen in
the distance on their way back. They, their wives, and
their children were kissed with emotion, as after a long
separation. Some shed tears of joy, others struck their
shields; and great bonfires were kindled. The fountains
of oratory were unloosed. Strombix, who in his
youth had been a buffoon at Antioch, felt himself inspired,
and, hoisted with wild gesticulations on the
shoulders of his comrades, began&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Nos quidem ad orbis terrarum extrema ut noxii
pellimur et damnati....</i>"
</p><p>
"They're sending us to the other end of the world
like criminals; and our families, whom we bought
back from slavery with the price of our blood, will fall
back into the hands of the Alemanni&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
He was unable to finish; the barracks were ringing
with piercing cries, and the noise, familiar to soldiers,
of scourges scoring the back. The legionaries were
lashing the detested centurion Cedo Alteram, and the
soldier who was administering the lashes to his superior
flung away the bloody rod, and to the general amusement,
imitating the cheery voice of the centurion,
called out&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Cedo Alteram!</i> Give me another!"
</p><p>
"To the palace! To the palace!" yelled the crowd.
"Let us make Julian, Augustus! Let us crown him
with a diadem!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
</p><p>
The mob rushed off, leaving in the courtyard the
half-dead centurion weltering in blood. Through the
dark clouds the stars sparkled here and there, and a
cold wind lifted the dust. The barred windows, doors,
and shutters of the palace were all hermetically sealed.
The building seemed tenantless.
</p><p>
Foreseeing the revolt, Julian had not left his quarters
nor shown himself to the soldiers, being occupied
in divinations. For two days and two nights he had
waited for a miracle. Clothed in the long white robe
of the Pythagoreans, lamp in hand, he was ascending
the steps which led to the highest tower. There the
assistant of Maximus of Ephesus was awaiting him,
and observing the stars. This assistant was no other
than Nogodarès, who once in the tavern owned by
Syrax at the foot of Mount Argæus had foretold the
future to the tribune Scuda.
</p><p>
"Well?" Julian asked anxiously.
</p><p>
"There's nothing to be seen! It looks as if heaven
and earth were conspiring."
</p><p>
A bat swooped by.
</p><p>
"Look, look! Perhaps some prediction can be made
from the manner of its flight?"
</p><p>
The night-wandering creature almost brushed
Julian's face with its cold wings, and vanished.
</p><p>
"Someone's soul approaches," murmured Nogodarès.
"Remember! this night something great will
be accomplished...."
</p><p>
The indistinct cries of the mutineers were borne
faintly up the wind.
</p><p>
"If a sign appears, come to me," said Julian as he
went down to his library.
</p><p>
With irregular restless strides he walked up and
down the room, halting every now and then to listen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
It seemed as if someone was following him; that a
curious cold air was blowing on the nape of his neck.
He wheeled round, but discovered nothing. He felt
the blood beating strongly in his temples. He resumed
his walk, and again it seemed that someone was murmuring
into his ear words that he had not time to
understand.
</p><p>
A servant entered, and announced that an old man
from Athens desired to see the Cæsar on urgent business.
Julian uttered a cry of elation and ran to meet the
new-comer. He thought he should see Maximus; but
he was mistaken. It was the high-priest of the mysteries
of Eleusis, whom also he had impatiently expected.
</p><p>
"Father!" exclaimed Julian, "save me! I must
know the will of the gods!... Let us come quickly,
for all is prepared."
</p><p>
Round the palace resounded deafening cries from the
revolted army, shaking the old brickwork of the walls.
But when a baggage-carrier, livid with fear, ran in exclaiming,
"Mutiny! The soldiers are breaking in the
iron gates!" Julian said with an imperious gesture,
"Fear nothing! We will arrange that matter presently.
Let no one come into my presence!" and taking
the high-priest by the hand he hastily led him into
a dark underground vault, and closed the heavy iron
door. All was there ready. Torch-flames were glittering
over the silver image of the Sun-god, and tripods
fuming; the holy vessels, full of water, wine, and
honey, stood prepared, with salt and flour to be sprinkled
on the bodies of the victims. Geese, doves, hens,
an eagle, and a white lamb which bleated plaintively,
stood round in different cages.
</p><p>
"Quicker, quicker!" exclaimed Julian, giving a
long dagger to the priest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
</p><p>
The old man, who was panting heavily, began hurriedly
to mutter prayers; he killed the lamb, put a
portion of the flesh and fat upon the coals of the altar,
and with mysterious exorcisms began the inspection of
its organs. With expert hands he drew forth the liver,
heart, and lungs, and scanned them from every side.
</p><p>
"The powerful shall be overthrown!" he said,
pointing to the heart, which was still warm; "a terrible
death...."
</p><p>
"Whose?" Julian asked. "His or mine?"
</p><p>
"I know not."
</p><p>
"You know not?"
</p><p>
"Cæsar," said the old man, "be not hasty. Decide
nothing to-night; wait for the day; the presages are
doubtful...."
</p><p>
He did not finish his sentence, but took another victim,
a gander, and then an eagle. Overhead the noise
of the crowd at the gates swept like the roar of a torrent.
Blows of a battering-ram shook the iron doors,
but Julian heard nothing. He examined the bloody
organs with eager curiosity.
</p><p>
The old sacrificial priest repeated:
</p><p>
"Decide nothing to-night; the gods are silent."
</p><p>
"But now is the moment!" cried Julian in vexation.
</p><p>
Nogodarès came in, and solemnly spoke:
</p><p>
"Julian, rejoice! to-night your destiny is decided
... but make haste! Afterwards it will be too late."
</p><p>
The soothsayer looked at the hierophant; the hierophant
at the soothsayer.
</p><p>
"Wait!" said the priest of Eleusis.
</p><p>
"Dare!" said Nogodarès.
</p><p>
Julian stood between the two, in perplexity scrutinising
both.
</p><p>
The faces of the augurs remained impenetrable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
</p><p>
"What is to be done?" he murmured to himself.
Then he remembered, and exclaimed joyfully:
</p><p>
"One moment! I have an ancient book in my
library, <i>Concerning Contradiction in Auguries</i>; we
shall see!"
</p><p>
He hurried to the library; but in a passage he encountered
the bishop Dorotheus, in sacerdotal dress,
bearing the crucifix and the sacred Viaticum.
</p><p>
"What is this?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"The Viaticum for your wife, who is dying, O
Cæsar!"
</p><p>
Dorotheus looked with severity at the robes of Julian,
his pale face, and his blood-stained hands.
</p><p>
"Your wife," continued the bishop, "desires to see
you before her death. Will you come?"
</p><p>
"Yes!... yes! later!... O gods!... another
ill omen."
</p><p>
He entered the library and began to rummage among
the parchments. Suddenly he heard a voice murmuring
distinctly in his ear:
</p><p>
"Dare! dare! dare!"
</p><p>
"Maximus, it is thou!" exclaimed Julian, wheeling
round.
</p><p>
There was no one in the dark apartment.
</p><p>
Julian's heart beat so strongly that he pressed his
hand against his side; a cold sweat stood on his forehead.
</p><p>
"This&mdash;this is what I was waiting for!" murmured
Julian. "The voice was 'his'; now, all doubt is
over!... I will go!"
</p><p>
The barred gates had given way with a crash.
Legionaries were pouring into the atrium, thrilling the
old palace with their cries, while the crimson glare of
the torches shone through the chinks of shutters like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
light of a conflagration. Not a minute was to be lost.
Casting away his white robes, Julian donned his armour,
paludamentum, war cloak, and helmet, buckled
on his sword, and ran down the principal staircase leading
to the entrance. He opened the door and presented
himself to the soldiers with a calm and unshaken demeanour.
All doubts had disappeared. While in
action his will never vacillated; but never up to that
day had he been conscious of such a fulness of inward
force, such clearness and self-possession of mind. In a
moment the crowd felt that supremacy. The pale face
of Julian was imperial and awe-striking, and at a gesture
from him the mob was silenced. Julian spoke to
the soldiers, asking them to restore order; he would
neither abandon them nor permit that they should be
taken from Gaul; on that head he would convince his
well-beloved brother, the Emperor Constantius.
</p><p>
"Down with Constantius!" interrupted the legionaries.
"Down with him who slew his brother! Thou
art our Emperor! Glory to Augustus Julian, the Invincible!"
</p><p>
Admirably did Julian affect surprise, and, as if
startled, lowered his eyes and turned aside his head
with a deprecating gesture of his lifted palms, as putting
away from him so criminal a gift. The shouts
redoubled.
</p><p>
"What is this?" said Julian, feigning dismay.
"You are ruining me and you are ruining yourselves.
Do you think that I can betray my sovereign?"
</p><p>
"Yes! your brother's murderer!" shouted the men.
</p><p>
"Silence!" answered Julian, striding towards the
crowd. "Do you not know that we are sworn...?"
</p><p>
Every movement was a hypocritical ruse. When the
soldiers surged round him he drew his sword from its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
sheath and pointed it against his own breast as if to
fall on it.
</p><p>
"Bravest of the brave! better die for Cæsar than
betray him!"
</p><p>
But the men, seizing his hands, disarmed him, and
many, falling at his feet, kissed them, weeping&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah! we are willing to die for you!"
</p><p>
Others stretched out their hands, groaning&mdash;
</p><p>
"Have pity on us; be our Augustus!"
</p><p>
The heart of Julian was thrilled. He loved these
rough faces, the barrack-atmosphere, and the unrivalled
enthusiasm in which he felt his own power.
</p><p>
He saw that the mutiny was dangerous and in earnest,
observing that the legionaries did not interrupt
each other, but shouted unanimously, and became suddenly
hushed, as if their action had been concerted
beforehand.
</p><p>
There was either a deafening hubbub, or absolute
silence.
</p><p>
Finally, Julian, with an effort that might well have
been thought sincere&mdash;
</p><p>
"My children! my dear comrades! behold me ...
I am yours in life and in death. I can refuse you
nothing!"
</p><p>
"Crown him! The diadem!" they cried, triumphantly.
</p><p>
But no diadem was to be found.
</p><p>
Strombix proposed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let Augustus order that his wife's necklet of
pearls be brought here!"
</p><p>
Julian answered that a woman's ornament would be
unfitting, and an ill presage with which to inaugurate
a reign.
</p><p>
But the men were unsatisfied. They insisted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
seeing a sign of regality shining on the head of their
chosen, to make him their Emperor indeed. One of the
legionaries snatched from his war-horse the phaleræ,
or forehead trapping, with its string of metal disks, for
the crowning of Augustus.
</p><p>
But neither did this please him, for the ornament
stank with the sweat of the horse. Everyone cast
about to find another decoration, and at last the standard-bearer
of the Petulant legion, the Sarmatian
Aragaris, pulled from his neck the metal chain denoting
his rank, and Julian wound it twice round his
own head. This chain made him Emperor of Rome.
</p><p>
"Hoist him on a shield! on a shield!" shouted the
soldiery.
</p><p>
Aragaris tendered his round buckler. Hundreds of
arms heaved the Emperor. He saw a sea of helmeted
heads, and heard, like the rolling of thunder, the
exultant cry&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory to Julian, the divine Augustus!"
</p><p>
It seemed the will of destiny. One by one the
torches were extinguished. The clamour died away;
and the eastern sky was barred with soft white bands.
The dark and dull mass of the palace-towers became
clear in all its ugliness; a single lighted window was
still visible. Julian guessed that this must be the light
in the cell where Helena lay dying.
</p><p>
And when at dawn the wearied army dispersed, he
went to the bedside of his wife. It was too late. The
dead woman lay quietly on her virgin couch; the lips
severely closed. Julian felt no remorse, but painful
curiosity moved him as he gazed at the dark face of his
wife, wondering&mdash;
</p><p>
"What was that last desire? What did she wish to
say to me?"

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XXII</h2>

<p>The Emperor Constantius meantime was passing
at Antioch a somewhat melancholy period. At
night he had alarming visions and kept six lamps burning
in his chamber till daybreak in the vain endeavour
to relieve his fears of darkness. Hour after hour
would he lie motionless and moody, starting at the
least sound. Once he dreamed he saw his father,
Constantine the Great, holding a sturdy and mischievous
child in his arms. Constantius took the child and
placed him on his right hand, attempting the while to
hold in his left a great ball of crystal. But the child
in wilfulness pushed the globe, which fell and broke;
and its fragments, piercing like needles, buried themselves
in the body of Constantius, darting with intolerable
pain, burning, and hissing into his brain, eyes,
and heart. The Emperor awoke, bathed in a cold perspiration.
He consulted sorcerers, diviners, celebrated
magicians. Troops were assembled at Antioch for a
campaign against Julian. Sometimes after a moody
fit of immobility the Emperor was seized with an impulse
to action; the greater number of Court officials
found this haste unreasonable, and confided to each
other their fears as to the mental state of the august
sovereign.
</p><p>
The autumn was reaching its end when he left Antioch.
At noon, about three miles from the city, near
the village of Hypocephalus, the Emperor saw an unknown
mutilated body lying on the road. Facing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
south the corpse was stretched to the right of Constantius,
who was on horseback. The head was separated
from the body.
</p><p>
The Emperor grew pale and turned away. None of
the riders round him uttered a word, all being aware
that the omen was an evil one. In the town of Tarsus
in Cilicia, Constantius had shivering fits and felt weakness,
but he paid them no attention nor consulted
leeches, believing that riding in the hot sun over the
steep mountains would produce reaction and relief.
</p><p>
He rode towards the little town of Mopsucrenam at
the foot of Mount Tarsus, the last halting-place before
crossing the Cilician border.
</p><p>
On the way he suffered several times from violent
giddiness, which obliged him to dismount and lie down
in a litter. Subsequently the eunuch Eusebius tells
how, when lying in the palanquin, the Emperor took
from his bosom and tenderly kissed a precious stone on
which was engraven the profile of the late Empress
Eusebia Aurelia.
</p><p>
At one of the cross-roads he asked whither one of the
ways led, and when he was told to the abandoned palace
of the kings of Cappadocia, at Macellum, his brow
clouded. Mopsucrenam was reached at night-fall. Constantius
was weary and full of gloom. Hardly had he
entered the house which had been prepared when one
of the courtiers, against the command of Eusebius,
thoughtlessly announced to the Emperor that two
couriers from the southern provinces were awaiting
him.
</p><p>
Constantius ordered them to be admitted, in spite
of the supplications of Eusebius, his favourite chamberlain,
who advised him to postpone business till the
morrow. The Emperor declared that he felt better,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and suffered from nothing but a slight pain at the nape
of his neck.
</p><p>
The first courier, trembling and livid, was ushered
in.
</p><p>
"Tell me all, immediately!" exclaimed Constantius,
dismayed at the man's expression.
</p><p>
The courier then narrated the audacious movements
of Julian, who, before the assembled army, had torn up
the Imperial rescript. Gaul, Pannonia, Aquitania,
had submitted to Julian, and the traitorous army was
advancing to encounter Constantius, with all the
legions to be gathered from those provinces.
</p><p>
The Emperor stood up, his face disfigured by fury,
and, seizing the messenger by the throat, shook him.
</p><p>
"You lie, caitiff! You lie! You lie!... There
is still a God in heaven to shield the kings of the earth
...and He will not permit, do you understand!...
Fools!... He will not permit...."
</p><p>
He had a spasm of weakness, and covered his eyes
with his hand; the courier, more dead than alive,
slunk to the door.
</p><p>
"To-morrow," stammered Constantius wildly; "to-morrow
we absolutely must set out!... by forced
marches, direct ... as the crow flies ... over the
mountains.... We absolutely must go to Constantinople."
</p><p>
Eusebius approached him, with the humblest of
bows&mdash;
</p><p>
"Divine Augustus! The Lord God has granted
you, you His chosen, victory over your enemies. You
have annihilated Magnentius, Constantius, Vetranio,
Gallus. You will crush this impious&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
But Constantius, wagging his head without listening,
muttered&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
</p><p>
"Then He exists not; if it is all true, and I am
single-handed, alone! Who dares to say that 'He'
exists, when such crimes can be accomplished! I've
been thinking so a long time...."
</p><p>
He cast a dull look on the courtiers present and
said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Call in the other."
</p><p>
A physician came up&mdash;a courtier-like person, with a
clean-shaven rosy face, an Armenian who assumed the
airs of a Roman patrician. He observed respectfully
that too keen emotion might be harmful to the Emperor,
that he should rest.... Constantius waved
him away like an irritating fly.
</p><p>
The second courier was shown in. He was Cintula,
the tribune of the Imperial stables, who had escaped
from Lutetia. He brought the terrible news that the
inhabitants of Sirmium<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> had opened their doors to
Julian, and welcomed him as the saviour of the country.
In two days he would debouch on the great Roman
road leading to Constantinople.
</p><p>
The Emperor either did not hear, or did not understand,
the last words of the messenger. His face became
strangely rigid. He made a gesture of dismissal
to all present. Eusebius alone remained to
talk the business over with him. In another quarter
of an hour Constantius ordered that he should be assisted
to his chamber, and made several steps. Then
a cry escaped him; he pressed his hands to his head,
as if he suddenly felt terrible pain. Courtiers ran to
support him. The Emperor did not lose consciousness.
By his face and movements, and the veins,
standing out like whipcord on his forehead, it was
evident that he was making fearful efforts to speak.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Finally he stammered slowly, word by word, as if being
throttled by an iron collar&mdash;
</p><p>
"I&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;speak&mdash;and&mdash;I&mdash;cannot!" Those
were his last words; paralysis had stricken the whole
of his right side. His arm and leg fell inert.
</p><p>
He was carried to bed, but his eyes were wakeful
and intelligent, and he struggled to utter something&mdash;some
important order perhaps. From his lips came
only confused sounds, like weak lowings. No one
understood what he wanted, and the invalid fixed his
clear gaze in turn on each present. Eunuchs, courtiers,
generals, slaves, thronged round the dying man,
helplessly desirous of doing his last behest.
</p><p>
At moments the clear eye became angered and the
lowing hoarse. At last Eusebius understood, and
brought wax and tablets. At the sight of these a flash
of joy was seen on the Emperor's face. He gripped
the steel stylus awkwardly, like a child. After some
struggles, he succeeded in tracing a few letters on the
soft wax, and the courtiers with difficulty deciphered
the word "<i>Baptism</i>." Constantius fixed his supplicating
look on Eusebius, and everybody wondered at not
having understood before. He was desirous of being
baptised before death, having, like his father Constantine,
always postponed this sacrament to the last, in
the belief that he could then miraculously cleanse his
soul and leave it whiter than snow. A messenger was
despatched for the bishop. There proved to be none
in Mopsucrenam, and recourse was had to the Arian
priest of the basilica. He was a timid man, with a
bird-like face, red-nosed, with a goat's beard, and a
provincial manner.
</p><p>
When disturbed by the messengers, Father Nymphodion
was enjoying his tenth wine-cup, and seemed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
too cheerful a mood. It was impossible to make clear
to him the matter in hand, and he grew angry at what
he believed to be raillery. But when at length convinced
that fate had designated him to baptise an Emperor
he nearly lost his reason. When he entered the
chamber of the sick man, the Emperor gazed on the
trembling priest with such humility that it was evident
he feared to die, and was eager to hasten the ceremony.
Meantime the town had been scoured in vain for a
basin of gold or silver. It is true that a jewelled one
was available, but it had served for the bacchic mysteries
of Dionysus; and the common copper basin used
by the parishioners of the basilica was therefore preferable.
This copper basin was brought to the bed and
warm water poured into it. The doctor was about to
feel its temperature, but the Emperor made a brusque
movement and groaned, lest the water should be sullied.
The dying man's tunic was taken off. Strong arms of
legionaries raised him, like a child, and immersed him.
The wasted face of Constantius, his eyes fixed and wide
open, stared at the cross fixed above the Labarum, the
golden standard of Constantine. It was an obstinate
and vacuous stare, as of children when they see some
dazzling object and cannot turn away from it.
</p><p>
The ceremony did not soothe the sick man, who
seemed to have forgotten everything. Volition came
into his eyes for the last time when Eusebius again
stretched out to him the waxen tablet, but Constantius,
unable to write, only traced with his finger the name
"<i>Julian</i>." Did he desire to pardon his enemy or to
bequeath his vengeance?
</p><p>
For three days he lay in the extremity of death;
courtiers murmured to each other that this was evidently
some special punishment of God, who would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
not permit him to die. But they referred to him always
as "The Divine Augustus," "His Holiness," and
"The Eternal." His sufferings must have been great;
the low moaning turned into a steady death-rattle,
which went on day and night. Courtiers came in and
went out, eagerly hoping for the end. The eunuch
Eusebius alone never left his master. Many a crime
had this eunuch upon his conscience; all the tangled
threads of reports, espials, and ecclesiastical broils were
gathered in his hands. But he alone in the palace
proved his love to his master, and at night when everyone
was sleeping, or had withdrawn, worn out by the
task of nursing, Eusebius remained by the bedside,
arranging pillows, cooling the dry lips with ice, or
kneeling at the feet of the Emperor in prayer. When
none saw, Eusebius would gently lift the purple coverlet
and weepingly kiss the feet, now pale and benumbed.
Once it seemed to him that Constantius
noticed this caress and thanked him with a look.
Something fraternal and tender passed between the
two cruel, ill-starred, and solitary men.
</p><p>
Eusebius closed the eyes of the Emperor; the Church
recited over him, before the body was committed to the
tomb&mdash;
</p><p>
"Rise again, O king of the earth! Answer the summons
of thy coming Judge, the King of kings!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XXIII</h2>

<p>Not far from Succi, a mountainous defile in the
Hæmus range<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> between M&oelig;sia and Thrace, two
men were making their way along a narrow path, at
night, through a forest of beeches. They were the
Emperor Julian and Maximus the enchanter. The full
moon was shining in a clear sky, and strangely illuminating
the gold and purple of autumn foliage. From
time to time a wan yellow leaf would fall swirling with
a slight rustle. The air was full of moisture and the
musty smell of a tardy autumn&mdash;that soft, chill melancholy
odour which puts men in mind of death. The
soft masses of leaves made a brushing sound under the
feet of the travellers, and round them in the silent
woods burned the magnificent obsequies of the departing
year.
</p><p>
"Master," asked Julian, "why is not that divine
lightness mine, that gaiety which used to make so
splendid the men of Hellas?"
</p><p>
"You are not a man of Hellas."
</p><p>
Julian sighed&mdash;
</p><p>
"Alas, our ancestors were barbarians, Medes; and
the sluggish blood of the North flows in my veins. It
is true, I am no son of the Hellenes!"
</p><p>
"My friend, Hellas has never existed," murmured
Maximus, with his old bewitching smile.
</p><p>
"What do you mean?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"The Hellas that you love has never existed."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
</p><p>
"Do you mean to say that my faith is futile?"
</p><p>
"We are only to believe," answered Maximus, "in
what is not, but shall be. Your Hellas shall exist,
shall be the reign, the kingdom of divine men, men
daring all things, fearing none."
</p><p>
"Fearing none!... Master, powerful enchantments
are thine.... Deliver my soul from fear!"
</p><p>
"Fear of what?"
</p><p>
"I cannot say, but from childhood I have been
afraid&mdash;afraid of life, of death, of myself, of the mystery
in all things, of the darkness.... I had an old
nurse, Labda, like a Parca, a Fate, who used to spin
me terrible tales of my family, the Flavii. These mad
old-wives' tales keep singing in my ears still, at night,
when I am alone. They will ruin me some day ... I
wish to be free, as one of the old Hellenes ... and I
have no gladness in me.... Sometimes I think I am
a coward, Master!... Master, save me! Deliver
me from that eternal fear, these consuming darknesses!"
</p><p>
"Ah, I have long known the need of your soul,"
said Maximus, gravely, "and from this very day I will
cleanse you from this Galilean corruption&mdash;slay the
shadow of Golgotha in the radiance of Mithra&mdash;warm
afresh your body, frozen at baptism, in the hot blood
of the Sun-god!... My son, rejoice! for I will give
you such freedom, such joy as no man on earth has yet
possessed!"
</p><p>
They issued from the wood, and followed a narrow
path, hewn through the rock, above a chasm in which
a torrent ran seething. Stones, loosened by their feet,
rolled echoing down and plunged into the water. High
over the forest they saw the distant snow-covered summits
of Mount Rhodope. Julian and Maximus at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
reached and entered the mouth of a cave. It was the
temple of the Sun-god Mithra, where mysteries, forbidden
by the Roman laws, were performed. In this
cavern there was no sign of splendour; the bleak walls
were engraven with cabalistic signs of Zoroastrian religion,
triangles, enlaced circles, winged beasts, and
constellations. Here and there the vaulted obscurity
was relieved by dull flames of torches or the form of an
initiating priest in strange and sweeping robes.
</p><p>
Julian was arrayed in the Olympian robe, embroidered
with Indian monsters, stars, suns, and hyperborean
dragons. He held a flambeau in his right hand. Maximus
had acquainted him with the responses to be made
to his initiator, and Julian had learned them by heart,
although their meaning hitherto was unintelligible to
him.
</p><p>
With Maximus he went down rock-hewn steps into a
long and deep foss. Here the air was already humid
and stifling; but to make it more so, overhead a wooden
trap-door, riddled with holes like a strainer, was lowered
across, from edge to edge. The trampling of
hoofs resounded, and the sacrificers placed three black
bulls, three white bulls, and a red bull with gilded
hoofs and horns on the trap above the two men.
Then the initiators, intoning a hymn which mingled
with the bellowing of the beasts, felled with axes one
bull after another. They fell on their knees and
struggled, the wooden framework trembled under
their weight, while the farthest vaults of the cavern
resounded to the cries of the red bull, which was hailed
as the god Mithra. Percolating through the holes in
the trap, the blood fell in a hot shower upon the head
of Julian. This slaying of the bull consecrated to the
Sun was the supreme mystery of the Pagans. Throwing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
off his outer clothes and standing in his white tunic
only, Julian offered head, breast, and all his limbs
to the terrible trickling rain. Then Maximus, shaking
the torch overhead, cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let thy soul be steeped in the expiating blood of
thy god, the Sun, in the purest blood of the ever radiant
heart of thy god, the Sun; let it be cleansed in
his morning and in his evening light! Dost thou, O
mortal, still hold anything in fear?"
</p><p>
"Yes," was the response.
</p><p>
"Let thy soul become a parcel of thy god, the Sun!
The quenchless and inviolable Mithra takes thee to
himself! Dost thou still fear anything, O mortal?"
</p><p>
"I fear nothing more on the earth," answered
Julian, who was now streaming with blood from head
to foot. "I am even as He is!"
</p><p>
"Take this crown," said Maximus, placing a wreath
of acanthus-leaves on the head of Julian, with the point
of his sword.
</p><p>
But the catechumen flung the coronal upon the
ground with a cry&mdash;
</p><p>
"The Sun only is my crown, the Sun alone!"
</p><p>
Then he stamped on the acanthus, and lifting his
arms skyward repeated a third time&mdash;
</p><p>
"Now, until death, my crown is the Sun!"
</p><p>
The mystery was over. Maximus kissed the initiate.
On the face of the old man as he did so hovered a gleam
of strange significance.
</p><p>
While they were retracing their steps through the
beech-forest the Emperor spoke to the enchanter&mdash;
</p><p>
"Maximus, I think you are hiding from me some
secret deeper yet." He turned towards the old man
his pale face, on which, as was the custom, the traces
of the sacred blood were not yet wiped away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
</p><p>
"What do you wish to know, Julian?"
</p><p>
"What lot shall fall to me?"
</p><p>
"You will conquer."
</p><p>
"And Constantius?"
</p><p>
"Constantius is no more."
</p><p>
"What mean you?"
</p><p>
"Wait! the Sun shall reveal your glory!"
</p><p>
Julian dared not question further. Both men regained
the camp in silence. In Julian's tent a courier
from Asia Minor, the tribune Cintula, stood waiting.
He knelt and kissed the edge of the Imperial paludamentum&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory to the divine Augustus Julian!"
</p><p>
"Do you come with a message from Constantius?"
</p><p>
"Constantius is no more!"
</p><p>
"What say you?"
</p><p>
Julian trembled and threw a glance at Maximus,
whose face remained inscrutable.
</p><p>
"By the will of God," continued Cintula, "your
enemy departed this life in the town of Mopsucrenam,
not far from Macellum."
</p><p>
That evening the army assembled on a hill. The
death of Constantius was already made known to them.
</p><p>
Augustus Claudius Flavius Julian took his station
on a hillock so that all the soldiers could see him;
crownless, weaponless, unarmoured, and enswathed
head to foot in purple. To conceal the traces of the
blood, which might not be washed off, he had enveloped
his head and veiled his face in the purple silk. In
this attire he bore the appearance rather of a sacrificial
priest than of an emperor. Behind him rose the ruddy
forest wrapping the base of Mount Hæmus. Above his
head hung, like a golden banner, the yellow branches
of a maple. Far as the eye could see, the plain of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Thrace lay below, crossed by the white marble pavement
of the Roman road stretching victoriously away
to the Propontic Sea. Julian gazed at his army.
When the legions moved their stations, red flashes from
the sunset were reflected upon burnished helmets,
breastplates, and eagles; the lances above the cohorts
seemed like lighted tapers. By Julian's side was
Maximus, who spoke in Cæsar's ear&mdash;
</p><p>
"Look forth upon this sight of glory! your hour is
come! Act now!"
</p><p>
The magician pointed to the Christian banner, the
Labarum, with its crest of the monogram of Christ,
the flag made on the pattern of that fiery standard
bearing the inscription, "Through this shalt thou conquer,"
which Constantine the Great had seen miraculous
in the heavens.
</p><p>
The troops made no stir. Julian in a clear and
solemn voice addressed them&mdash;
</p><p>
"Comrades, our work is finished. Now we will go
to Constantinople! Give thanks to the Olympians, who
have given us the victory!"
</p><p>
These words were only heard by the first ranks, but
there were numerous Christians among them. These
were roused by the last startling expression.
</p><p>
"Lord have mercy on us! what is it he says?" cried
one.
</p><p>
"Do you see that old man with the white beard?"
said another to his comrade.
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"That's the Devil, who, in the body of Maximus
the enchanter, is tempting Cæsar!"
</p><p>
But the more distant ranks, who had not heard
Julian's words, cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory to Augustus Julian! Glory! Glory!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
and louder and louder yet from outskirts of the hill,
as far as they were covered by the legions, arose a
cry repeated by thousands of voices&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory!... Glory!..."
</p><p>
Mountains, air, earth, and forest trembled with the
voice of the multitude.
</p><p>
"Look, look!" murmured the dismayed Christians;
"the Labarum is being lowered!" And in fact the
holy banner was being veiled before the Emperor. A
military blacksmith came down from the wood with a
brazier and red-hot pincers.
</p><p>
Julian, whose face, in spite of the ruddy gleams of
the purple and the sun, was dark with strong emotion,
wrenched the golden cross, with its monogram of
precious stones, from the staff of the Labarum. Pearls,
emeralds, and rubies were scattered on the ground, and
the glittering cross buried in the earth, stamped under
the sandal of the Roman Cæsar.
</p><p>
From a casket Maximus immediately drew forth a
little silver statue of the Sun-god, Mithra-Helios; and
the smith in a few instants soldered it to the staff of
the Labarum.
</p><p>
Before the army had recovered from its astonishment
and fear, Constantine's sacred banner rose above the
head of the Emperor, crowned with the image of
Apollo. An old soldier, who was a devout Christian,
turned away and veiled his eyes to avoid seeing the
sight of horror.
</p><p>
"Sacrilege! sacrilege!" he muttered, turning pale.
</p><p>
"Woe, woe, upon us!" groaned another; "Satan has
entoiled our Emperor!"
</p><p>
Julian knelt before the standard and, stretching out
his arms to the little silver image, exclaimed&mdash;

"Glory to the invincible Sun, king of all gods!...
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Augustus worships the eternal Helios; god of light,
god of reason, god of the gladness and joy upon Olympus!"
</p><p>
The last rays of sunset lighted the bold beauty of
the god of Delphi, and rayed his head. The legionaries
stood in silence, save that in the wood the dry leaves
could be heard falling. The conflagration of the sunset,
the purple of the sacrificial king, the withered
woods, all these breathed a magnificence as of sumptuous
obsequies. One of the men in the front rank muttered
a single word so distinctly that it reached Julian's
ear, and thrilled him&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Anti-Christ!</i>"

<h2 class="p2">I</h2>

<p>Hard by the stables, in the Hippodrome of Constantinople,
there was a room which served as a
sort of common den for grooms, women-riders, actors,
and charioteers. Even in daytime lamps were kept
burning in this stifling resort, where the air smelt
strongly of dung-heap and stable. When the curtain at
the door was lifted a dazzling flood of light invaded
this den; and in the sunny distance could be seen
empty tiers of seats, and the magnificent staircase
joining the Imperial box to the apartments of Constantine's
palace. Egyptian obelisks also were seen in the
arena and in the centre, on the yellow sand, a gigantic
sacrificial altar of marvellous workmanship, wrought
of three entwined serpents of bronze, bearing on their
flat heads a Delphian tripod.
</p><p>
Crackings of whips, shouts of riders, snortings of
horses, came from the arena, and the muffled sound
of wheels on the soft sand went by like a rushing of
wings. No races were going on, but merely the preparatory
exercise for the races which were to take place
a few days later. In one corner of the stable a naked
athlete, rubbed over with oil and covered with dust, a
girdle of leather round his hips, was raising and lowering
dumb-bells. Throwing back his shaggy head, he
arched his back till the joints cracked, and at every
effort his face grew crimson and the veins of his neck
swelled.
</p><p>
Preceded by slaves, a young Byzantine woman of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
patrician rank approached the athlete. She was dressed
in a morning robe of delicate hues; and a veil thrown
over her head covered her aristocratic and slightly-faded
features.
</p><p>
She was a zealous Christian, widow of a Roman senator;
beloved of monks for her generous donations to
monasteries, and abounding charity. At first she concealed
her escapades, but soon perceived that to combine
the love of the church with the love of the circus
was quite the fashion.
</p><p>
Everybody knew that Stratonice detested the coxcombs
of Constantinople, curled and painted, nervous
and capricious as she was herself; it was her temperament
and fancy to mingle the most costly perfumes of
Arabia with the enervating heat of circus and stable.
Hot tears of repentance, fervent confessions to tactful
confessors, were of no avail; and this little woman,
frail and delicate as some ivory trinket, cared for
nothing but the coarse caresses of a certain famous
circus-rider.
</p><p>
Stratonice was watching the exercises of the gymnast
with a practised eye, while he, preserving a stupid expression
on his beefy face, paid her not the slightest
attention. She muttered something to her slave, with
simple wonder admiring the powerful back and the terrible
Herculean muscles rolling under the red skin of
the shoulders, when, bending with deep inhalations,
like the wind of a forge, he raised the iron weights
above his handsome tawny head.
</p><p>
The curtain was lifted. The crowd of spectators recoiled,
and two Cappadocian mares, a white and a black,
pushed into the stables, ridden by a young horsewoman,
who, with a guttural cry, adroitly leapt from
one beast to another, and thence to the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
</p><p>
She was solidly-built, hale and sprightly as her mares,
and upon her bare body shone fine drops of sweat.
</p><p>
Zephirinus, the elegant sub-deacon of the Basilica of
the Holy Apostles, smilingly hastened towards her.
A great lover of the circus, a frequenter of races and
racing-stables, this young man would wager heavy
sums for the blue (<i>veneta</i>) against the green (<i>prasina</i>).
With his red-heeled morocco boots, his painted eyes,
and curled hair, Zephirinus had much more the appearance
of a young girl than of a servant of the church.
Behind him stood a slave, burdened with packets of
pretty stuffs and boxes, purchases of every kind from
famous shops.
</p><p>
"Krokala, here are the perfumes you asked for the
day before yesterday."
</p><p>
The sub-deacon offered the equestrienne a flask
sealed with blue wax.
</p><p>
"I've been hunting in shops all the morning, and
have only found it in one. It is pure nard, and arrived
yesterday from Apamea!"
</p><p>
"And what purchases are these?" demanded Krokala.
</p><p>
"Oh, the silks in fashion!... ornaments&mdash;sets of
jewels!"
</p><p>
"All of them for your&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p><p>
"Yes, all for my most noble sister, the devout matron
Bezilla; one <i>must</i> help one's near relatives! She
trusts nobody's taste but mine for choosing stuffs.
From early morning I am under her orders. My head
goes round, but I don't complain. No!... No!...
Bezilla is so good ... such a holy woman!"
</p><p>
"Unfortunately old," laughed Krokala. "Here,
boy, wipe the sweat off the black mare with fresh fig leaves."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
</p><p>
"Old age also has its virtues," replied the sub-deacon,
gently rubbing together his white hands; they
were loaded with rings.
</p><p>
Then he whispered in Krokala's ear: "This evening?"
</p><p>
"I'm not sure ... perhaps. Are you going to
bring me something?"
</p><p>
"You needn't be afraid, Krokala, I won't come
empty-handed! There's a piece of stuff ... a quite
marvellous pattern."
</p><p>
He kissed two of his fingers, adding: "Something
perfectly dazzling!"
</p><p>
"Where did you pick it up?"
</p><p>
"Oh, at Pyrmix's of course, near the baths. For
what do you take me? You might make a long
<i>tarantinidion</i> out of it. You can't imagine what embroidery
there is on it! Guess the subject!"
</p><p>
"I don't know!... Flowers&mdash;animals?"
</p><p>
"In gold and silk&mdash;the whole story of Diogenes, the
Cynic."
</p><p>
"Ah, that must be pretty!" cried the girl. "Come,
by all means, I shall expect you."
</p><p>
Zephirinus glanced at the <i>clepsydra</i>, a water-clock
placed in a niche in the wall.
</p><p>
"I am late&mdash;quite late! I must go on to a money-lender,
a jeweller, then the patriarch, and then to the
church. Till then, good-bye."
</p><p>
"Don't forget," Krokala cried to him, with a mischievous
gesture.
</p><p>
The sub-deacon disappeared, followed by his slave.
</p><p>
A crowd of grooms, dancing girls, gymnasts, and
tamers of wild beasts invaded the stables. With his
face protected by a mask, the gladiator, Mermillion,
was heating a bar of iron red-hot; he was taming a lion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
newly received from Africa, and which could be heard
roaring through the stable-wall.
</p><p>
"You'll be the death of me, granddaughter, and
you'll go to hell yourself! Oh, oh, how my back
hurts! I'm done for!"
</p><p>
"Is that you, grandfather Gnyphon? What do you
want?" asked Krokala in a vexed voice.
</p><p>
Gnyphon was a little old man with cunning tearful
eyes, which shone under eyebrows active as two white
mice. He had the violet nose of a drunkard, wore
Libyan breeches, patched and botched here and there,
and on his head a Phrygian cap.
</p><p>
"You've come again for money," grumbled Krokala,
"and you've been drinking again."
</p><p>
"It's a sin to use such language. You'll have to
answer for my soul to God. Just think what you've
brought me to. I am living now in the Smokatian
quarter; I hire a little cellar from an image-carver,
and every day I have to see him making his horrible
idols in marble. There's a nice occupation for a
Christian! I scarcely open my eyes in the morning,
when tap, tap, tap,&mdash;my landlord's hammering his
marble&mdash;bringing white devils into the world; damnable
gods that stand laughing at me. How am I to
keep out of the wine-shop? O Lord, have mercy on
us! I'm simply weltering in Pagan horrors, like a
pig in a sty, and it'll be reckoned against us ... and
who'll be responsible, I'd like to know? Why, you!
You're rolling in money, and yet you leave a poor
miserable old man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p><p>
"You lie, Gnyphon! You're not poor; you're a
miser; you've got a money-box under the bed!"
</p><p>
Gnyphon made a despairing gesture: "Hush&mdash;hush!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
</p><p>
To change the subject he said: "Do you know
where I'm going?"
</p><p>
"To the tavern, of course!"
</p><p>
"Worse than that. To the Temple of Dionysus!
That temple, since the days of holy Constantine, has
been buried under rubbish; but to-morrow, by the august
order of the Emperor Julian, it will be all shining
again. And I've hired myself out to do the sweeping,
although I shall lose my soul and be packed off to hell
for it. But I've allowed myself to be tempted because
I'm poor and hungry. My granddaughter doesn't
do anything to support me.... That's what I've
come to!"
</p><p>
"You let me be, Gnyphon. Here you are! Now
go! And don't come again when you're drunk!"
</p><p>
Krokala flung some pieces of silver to her grandfather,
and then, leaping on an Illyrian stallion, stood
erect on his croup, touched him with the whip, and set
off at a gallop round the Hippodrome. Gnyphon
clacked his tongue, and said with pride&mdash;
</p><p>
"To think it was I who brought her up!"
</p><p>
The firm, bare body of the horsewoman shone in the
morning sun, and her floating red hair matched the
colour of the stallion.
</p><p>
"Eh, Zotick," cried Gnyphon to an old slave who
was raking horse-dung into a basket, "come with me
to clean the temple of Dionysus! You're a master in
these things! I'll pay you three obols for it."
</p><p>
"Of course I will," answered Zotick. "Just a moment
to trim the lamp for the goddess, and I'm at
your service."
</p><p>
The goddess was Atalanta, patron of grooms, dunghills,
and stables. Coarsely carven in wood, and looking
little more than a smoky log, Atalanta figured in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
damp corner. But Zotick, who had been bred among
horses, used to worship her, often praying with tears
in his eyes, arraying her coarse blockish feet with
sweet violets, in the belief that she healed all his ills,
and would preserve him in life and in death.
</p><p>
Gnyphon went out into the open space, the Forum
of Constantine, which was circular, and adorned with
colonnades and triumphal arches. In the midst a
gigantic porphyry column rose from a massive pedestal,
and bore on its summit, at a height of a hundred and
twenty cubits, a bronze statue of Apollo by Phidias,
which had been carried off from a Phrygian city. The
head of the Sun-god had been broken, and, with barbaric
taste, the head of the Christian Emperor, the
apostolic Constantine, had been fitted in its stead to
the neck of the image.
</p><p>
His brow was surrounded by gilt rays. In his right
hand Apollo Constantine held the sceptre, and in his
left the globe. At the foot of the colossus was lodged
a little Christian chapel, a kind of palladium, in which
worship was still offered in the time of Constantine.
The Christians defended the practice by the argument
that in the bronze body of Apollo, within the Sun-god's
very breast, a talisman was hidden&mdash;a piece of the Most
Holy Cross brought from Jerusalem. The Emperor
Julian closed this chapel.
</p><p>
Gnyphon and Zotick proceeded along a narrow and
lengthy street, which led straight to the Chalcedonian
stairs, not far from the fortress. Many public edifices
were being built, and others were rebuilding, for so hastily
had they been erected to please Constantius that
they already were crumbling away. Inquisitive gazers
were wandering in this street, stopping at merchants'
shops; porters were passing by, slaves following their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
masters. Overhead, hammers resounded; cranes were
creaking, and saws grinding the white stone. Labourers
were heaving at the end of ropes huge timbers, and
blocks of marble glittered against the blue. A smell
of damp plaster came from the new houses, and a fine
white dust fell on the heads of passers-by. On this
side and that, between the dazzling white walls steeped
in sunlight, the smiling blue waves of the Propontic,
trimmed with galley-sails like the wings of sea-gulls,
shone at the end of narrow alleys.
</p><p>
Gnyphon heard, as he went by, a conversation between
two workmen who were weighing mortar into a
sack&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why did you become a Christian?" asked one of
them.
</p><p>
"Just think, the Christians have six times as many
feast days as Hellenists! Nobody harms you....
I advise you to follow my example. One is much freer
among Christians."
</p><p>
Where four roads met, the pressure of a crowd pinned
Gnyphon and Zotick against the wall. In the middle
of the street there was a block in the traffic; the chariots
could neither advance nor draw back; shouts,
oaths, blows of the whip, were exchanged. Forty oxen
were dragging, on an enormous stone-wheeled cart, a
jasper column. The earth shook under its weight.
</p><p>
"Whither are you dragging that?" asked Gnyphon.
</p><p>
"From the Basilica to the Temple of Hera. The
Christians had carried it off for their church. Now it
is going back to its proper position."
</p><p>
Gnyphon glanced at the dirty wall against which he
was leaning, on which Pagan urchins had drawn the
usual impious caricatures of the Christians.
</p><p>
Gnyphon turned and spat with indignation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
</p><p>
On one side of the crowded market-place they observed
the portrait of Julian, arrayed in all the symbols
of Imperial power. The winged god Hermes was coming
down from the clouds towards him. The portrait
was fresh and the colours not yet dry.
</p><p>
Now according to the Roman law every passer-by
had to salute any picture of Augustus.
</p><p>
The Agoranome, or inspector of the market, stopped
a little old woman carrying a large basket of cabbages.
</p><p>
"I never salute the gods," wept the old woman.
"My father and mother were Christians."
</p><p>
"You haven't got to salute the god, but the Emperor!"
</p><p>
"But the Emperor is alongside of the god! So how
should I salute him?"
</p><p>
"No matter! You were told to salute and not to
argue!"
</p><p>
Gnyphon dragged Zotick farther on as quickly as
possible.
</p><p>
"Devilish trick," he grumbled, "either salute the
accursed Hermes, or be accused of insulting the sovereign!
No way out!... Oh! oh! oh! the day of
Antichrist! In one way or another we're always
sinning! When I see you, Zotick, envy gnaws my
very soul. You live with your dunghill goddess, and
have no cares."
</p><p>
They reached the Temple of Dionysus, hard by a
Christian monastery, the windows and doors of which
were fast barred as against the approach of an enemy.
The Hellenists accused the monks of having pillaged
the temple.
</p><p>
When Gnyphon and Zotick went into the temple,
carpenters and timberers were already at work. The
planks which had been used to close the quadrilateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
to the sky were dragged down, and the sun poured into
the gloomy building.
</p><p>
"Just look at the cobwebs, look, look!" Between
the capitals of the columns hung masses of grey webs,
which were being hastily cleaned away by means of
rag-mops on immense poles. A bat, disturbed in his
lair, flew away from a dark crevice, rushing hither and
thither to hide himself from the light, striking himself
against all the corners. The rustling of his soft wings
could be distinctly heard. Zotick began sorting the
rubbish and throwing it into baskets while the old man
mumbled, "Ah, these cursed fellows! what foulness
they have heaped up!"
</p><p>
A great bunch of rusty keys was brought up and the
treasure-room opened. The monks had carried off
everything of value. Precious stones encrusted on the
sacrificial cups were gone, the gold and purple adornments
on the vestments had been torn off. When the
splendid sacrificial robe was displayed a brown cloud of
moths escaped from its folds. At the bottom of the
hollow of a tripod, Gnyphon saw a handful of ashes,
the remains of myrrh burned before the triumph of the
Christians by the last priest during the last sacrifice.
</p><p>
From this heap of sacred rubbish, poor rags, and
broken goblets, rose a perfume of death and mildew,
a sad and tender odour, as of incense to gods profaned.
</p><p>
A gentle melancholy came over Gnyphon's heart.
He smiled, remembering something perhaps of his
childhood; sweet cakes of barley and thyme, field
daisies and jessamine which he used to carry with his
mother to the altar of the village goddess; his childish
prayers, not to the distant God, but to the little gods
polished by the frequent touch of hands, carven in
beechwood&mdash;the holy Penates. He pitied the vanished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
gods, and sighed sadly, but suddenly returned to himself
and muttered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Suggestions of the Devil!"
</p><p>
The workmen were carrying up a heavy slab of marble,
an antique bas-relief, stolen many years before and
discovered in the hovel of a cobbler whose kitchen oven
it had served to repair. Philomena, the old wife of
a neighbouring clothier, a devout Christian, hated the
cobbler's wife, who used to let her ass stray into Philomena's
cabbage-yard. War had been maintained between
them for years, but the Christian woman was in
the end triumphant; for acting on her information the
workmen had penetrated into the cobbler's house, and
in order to carry off the bas-relief and slab had been
obliged to demolish the oven.
</p><p>
This was a terrible blow to the cobbler's wife.
Brandishing her shovel, she called down vengeance
from all the gods on the impious; pulled her hair out
in handfuls, groaning over her scattered pots and pans
while her children squealed round her like the young
birds of a devastated nest. But the bas-relief was
carried off, despite her struggles, and Philomena set
about the work of cleansing it. The draper's wife zealously
scrubbed the marble which had been blackened
by smoke and made greasy with spilt broth. Little by
little the severe lines of the divine sculpture became
visible. The young Dionysus, naked and proud, lay
half-reclined, as if fatigued by Bacchic feasting, letting
his hand, which held a cup, fall idly. A leopardess
was licking up the last drops from the goblet, and the
god, giver of joy to all living things, was gazing with
a benign smile at the strength of the beast subdued by
the grape. The bas-relief was hauled into position.
The jeweller, clambering up before the image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
Dionysus, inlaid the orbits of the god with two splendid
sapphires, to serve as eyes.
</p><p>
"What's he doing there?" asked Gnyphon.
</p><p>
"Can't you see? They are eyes."
</p><p>
"Yes, certainly, but where do the stones come
from?"
</p><p>
"From the monastery."
</p><p>
"But why have the monks allowed it?"
</p><p>
"How could they prevent it? The divine Augustus
Julian himself ordered it. The god's blue eyes were
used as an ornament on the robe of the Crucified that's
all.... They talk about charity and justice, and
they themselves are the worst of brigands! See how
beautifully the stones fit into their old setting!..."
</p><p>
The god fixed his sapphire eyes on Gnyphon. The
old man recoiled and crossed himself, seized with dread.
</p><p>
"Lord have mercy on us! It's horrible!"
</p><p>
Remorse filled his soul, and while sweeping he began,
as was his wont, to talk to himself&mdash;
</p><p>
"Gnyphon! Gnyphon! what a poor creature you
are!... Just like a mangy dog one might say....
You're ending your days in a nice way! Why have
you gone and damned yourself? The fiend has over-tempted
you!... And now you go into everlasting
fire without a chance of salvation. You've smirched
soul and body, Gnyphon, by serving the abomination
of the heathen!... Better had it been for thee hadst
thou never been born!"
</p><p>
"What are you groaning at, old man?" Philomena
the draper's wife enquired.
</p><p>
"My heart is heavy!... Oh, how heavy!"
</p><p>
"Are you a Christian?"
</p><p>
"Christian?&mdash;I am a betrayer of Christ!" answered
Gnyphon, using his broom vigorously.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
</p><p>
"Would you like me to take away your sin so that
not a trace of heathen defilement shall stick to you?
You see I'm a Christian too, and yet afraid of nothing.
Do you think I'd have undertaken work like this, if I
hadn't known how to purify myself after it?"
</p><p>
Gnyphon stared at her, incredulous.
</p><p>
But the draper's wife, having ascertained that nobody
could hear them, muttered mysteriously&mdash;
</p><p>
"Yes!... there is a means! I must tell you
about it! A pilgrim made me a present of a little bit
of Egyptian wood, called persis, which grows at Hermopolis,
in the Thebaïd. When Jesus and His mother
on their ass were going through the gates of the town,
the persis tree bowed down before them to the earth;
and ever since it has been a miraculous healer. I've
got a little splinter of it, and I'll break off a bit for
you. There's such a power in that wood, that if you
put a bit into a vat of water and leave it there for a
night the water becomes holy. You'll just wash
yourself from head to foot in it, and the heathen
abomination will leave you like magic, and you'll feel
yourself light and pure. Isn't it written in the Bible,
'Thou shalt dip in the water and shalt become as
white as snow'?"
</p><p>
"Oh, my benefactress!" groaned Gnyphon, "save
me! Give me a chip of that wonderful wood!"
</p><p>
"Ah! you may well call it precious!... Just to
do a good turn to a neighbour I'll give it you for a
drachma."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
</p><p>
"What's that you're saying, mother? Why, I
never earned a drachma in my life! Will you take
three obols?"<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
</p><p>
"Miser!" cried the draper's wife indignantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
</p><p>
"You stick at a drachma!... Isn't your immortal
soul worth so much?"
</p><p>
"But after all do you think I shall be quite pure?"
objected Gnyphon. "Perhaps the sin has so soaked
into me that nothing can...."
</p><p>
"I'll solemnly swear to it," insisted the draper's
wife. "Try it and you'll feel the miracle at once!...
Your soul will shine like the sun&mdash;as pure as a
white dove...."

<h2 class="p2">II</h2>

<p>At Constantinople Julian organised Bacchic processions.
Seated in a chariot drawn by white
mules, he held in his right hand a golden thyrsus, surmounted
by cedar-fruit, and in the other a cup garlanded
with ivy. The rays of the sun flooded the
crystal wine-cup with vermilion. On each side of the
chariot paced tame leopards, sent from the island of
Serendib. In front, Bacchantes sang to the beat of
timbrels, waving bright torches; and through the
clouds of smoke lads, wearing the horns of Fauns,
spilt wine into goblets. As they pushed laughing
along, the red wine often splashed the bare shoulder of
some Bacchante, and dashed the sunshine with rosy
spray. An obese old man, a certain rascally money-lender&mdash;who,
by the way, was head of the Imperial
Treasury,&mdash;mounted on an ass, played the part of Silenus
to perfection. The Bacchantes danced along,
waving their hands towards the Emperor&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
</p><p>
Suddenly Julian heard a burst of laughter, the shrill
scream of a woman, and the quavering voice of an old
man&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah, my pretty chicken!"
</p><p>
It was the Bacchic priest, a good-humoured septuagenarian,
who had pinched the bare elbow of a comely
Bacchante. Julian's face darkened, and he summoned
the old dotard, who ran up, still dancing&mdash;
</p><p>
"My friend," whispered Julian in his ear, "observe
the dignity which befits your age and rank!"
</p><p>
"I am a simple and unlearned man. And I may
venture to tell your Majesty that while philosophy is
beyond me, I venerate the gods. Ask anyone you
please on that head&mdash;I have always been faithful to
them. Only ... when I see a pretty girl ... my
blood gets up! I am an old satyr...." Seeing the
displeased face of the Emperor he stopped, assumed a
more solemn air, and relapsed into still denser stupidity.
</p><p>
"Who is that young girl?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"She who is carrying the sacred vessels on her
head?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"A courtesan of Chalcedon...."
</p><p>
"What!... You have authorised a courtesan to
touch the holy vessels of the gods with her foul hands!"
</p><p>
"But, divine Augustus, you yourself ordained this
procession. Who was there to choose from? All the
noble women are Galileans. And then ... none of
them would have consented to have exhibited themselves
half-naked...."
</p><p>
"Then they are all...."
</p><p>
"No, no! Some of them are dancing-girls, tragic
actresses, horsewomen from the Hippodrome. See how
gay they are and free from false shame! Believe me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
the people like that! That's what they want. And
there's a patrician woman!..."
</p><p>
The last-named was a Christian, an old maid looking
out for husbands. On her head rose a helmet-shaped
wig, a galerum made of blond hair powdered with gold&mdash;thickly
covered with gems as an Indian idol; impudently
painted, she drew her tiger-skin across her
withered bosom, and smiled affectedly.
</p><p>
Julian looked down on the people with a sudden impulse
of distaste.
</p><p>
Rope-dancers, drunken legionaries, venal women,
circus-riders, gymnasts, actors, swarmed and wantoned
all round him.
</p><p>
The procession arrived at a place where four streets
met. One of the Bacchantes ran to a tavern, whence
came an unpleasant smell of rancid frying fish, and
bought some greasy cakes for three obols. These she
ate, greedily licking her lips; and finished by wiping
her hands on the purple silk of her robes, which
had been granted for the procession by the Imperial
Treasury.
</p><p>
The chorus of Sophocles soon became wearisome.
Husky voices took up a street-song. The whole proceeding
appeared to Julian to have been desecrated.
A drunken man was picked up; and some thieves,
playing the part of Fauns, were arrested. They defended
themselves, and a fight ensued. The only personages
in the whole company whose demeanour
remained dignified and beautiful were the panthers.
</p><p>
At last they drew near the temple. Julian came
down from his chariot.
</p><p>
"Can I really present myself before the altar of
Dionysus surrounded by this human refuse?"
</p><p>
A chill of disgust ran through his body. He saw the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
brutal faces wasted with debauchery, corpse-like
through their paint; the painful nudity of bodies deformed
by fasting and anæmia. He breathed the
atmosphere of low wine-shops, houses of ill-fame. The
breath of the crowd, tainted with rotten fish and sour
wine, smote him through the aromatic smoke. Scrolls
of papyrus were stretched out to him from every side:
</p><p>
"I was promised a place in your stables.... I have
been paid nothing for renouncing Christ...."
</p><p>
"Don't desert us, Divine Augustus! Protect us!
We denied for your sake the faith of our fathers!...
If you give us up what will become of us?"
</p><p>
These were the voices drowned by the chorus of the
feast.
</p><p>
Julian went into the temple, and contemplated the
marvellous statue of Dionysus. His eyes, weary with
human deformity, reposed on the pure lines of that
divine body. He became oblivious of the crowd as if
he were alone&mdash;the only man amidst a herd of animals.
</p><p>
The Emperor proceeded to the sacrifice. The people
watched with amazement the Roman Cæsar, as Pontifex
Maximus, in his zeal for religion doing the work of a
slave&mdash;splitting wood, bringing twigs, drawing water,
and cleansing the altar.
</p><p>
A rope-dancer said to his neighbour&mdash;
</p><p>
"Look how he keeps at it! He really loves his
gods!"
</p><p>
"By this right hand," remarked the other, "few
people care for father and mother as he cares for his
gods!"
</p><p>
"You see," laughed a third, "how he puffs out his
cheeks to kindle the fire again!... Blow, blow!...
It won't catch!... Your uncle Constantine
put <i>that</i> fire out."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
</p><p>
The flames jetted up, illumining the Emperor's face.
</p><p>
Dipping the holy water brush into a shallow cup, a
silver patine used to cover the chalice, he besprinkled
the sacrificial water over the heads of the crowd. Some
grimaced, others started, at feeling the cold drops on
their faces.
</p><p>
When all the ceremonies were over, Julian remembered
that he had prepared a philosophical discourse
for the people.
</p><p>
"Men," said he, "the god Dionysus is the beginning
of your souls' liberty. Dionysus breaks every
chain that binds you; he mocks the strong, sets free
the slave...."
</p><p>
But he perceived such a dull stupidity upon every
face, such an expression of tedium and weariness, that
the words died on his lips. A mortal disgust for
humanity arose in his heart. He made a sign to the
lance-bearers to come round him.
</p><p>
Grumbling and disappointed, the crowd dispersed.
</p><p>
"I'm going straight to church to get absolution.
Do you think I shall be forgiven?" said one of the
Fauns, snatching off his own false beard and horns
with an angry gesture.
</p><p>
"It wasn't worth losing one's soul for that, eh?"
observed with wrath a lady of doubtful reputation.
</p><p>
"Nobody wants your soul, or would give three
obols for it!"
</p><p>
"The cursed devils!" yelled a drunkard. "They
didn't give us enough wine to get the taste of it!"
</p><p>
In the sacristy of the temple the Emperor washed
face and hands, took off the splendid Dionysian dress,
and put on again the simple white tunic of the Pythagoreans.
The sun was declining, and he waited the fall
of dusk to retrace his way to the palace unperceived.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian went into the sacred wood of Dionysus, where
the silence was broken only by the humming of bees
and the tinkle of a brook. A sound of steps made him
turn round. It was his old friend, one of Maximus'
favourite pupils, the young Alexandrian doctor, Oribazius.
</p><p>
They walked on the narrow path side by side. The
sun was shining through large golden leaves of the
vine.
</p><p>
"Look!" said Julian smiling. "Here great Pan is
still alive!"
</p><p>
Then in a lower tone he added, hanging his head&mdash;
</p><p>
"Oribazius!... You saw it?"
</p><p>
"Yes," responded the student. "But perhaps the
fault lay with you, Julian.... What did you hope
for?"
</p><p>
The Emperor made no answer.
</p><p>
They came near a little ruined temple that ivy had
invaded and overrun. Fragments lay about in the
deep grass. A single column only remained standing;
and on its lovely capital, clear-cut as the petals of a
lily, shone the last rays of sunset.
</p><p>
The friends sat down on the flags together and inhaled
the air, sweet with mint and thyme and wormwood.
Julian put the leaves aside and pointing to an
antique broken bas-relief&mdash;
</p><p>
"Oribazius! That is what I hoped for!"
</p><p>
The bas-relief represented a religious procession of
the ancient Athenians.
</p><p>
"That is what I desired ... beauty like theirs!
Why from day to day do men become more and more
deformed and misfeatured? Where are the immortal
old men, the austere heroes, the proud lads, the pure
women in their white and floating robes? Where is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
that strength, that gaiety of heart? Galileans! Galileans!
what have you done with these things?"
</p><p>
He gazed at the bas-relief with eyes full of infinite
sadness and infinite love.
</p><p>
"Julian," asked Oribazius, gently, "do you believe
in Maximus?"
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"Wholly?"
</p><p>
"What do you mean?"
</p><p>
"I've always thought, Julian, that you suffer from
the same malady as your enemies, the Christians!"
</p><p>
"What malady?"
</p><p>
"Faith in miracles."
</p><p>
Julian shook his head.
</p><p>
"If there be neither miracles nor gods my whole
life is a madness!... No, we won't speak of that.
And do not be too hard upon me on account of my
love for ancient ceremonies. I scarcely can explain it
to you. The old simple things stir tears in me; and I
love the evening more than the morning, autumn better
than spring. I love all that is fleeting!... even
the perfume of flowers that have faded.... What
would you have, my friend? The gods shaped me so!...
That pleasant melancholy, that golden faery
twilight, are necessary to me. In the depth of antiquity
there is to me something ineffably gracious and
fair such as I find in no other region&mdash;the shining of
sunset on marble mellowed by time. Do not rob me
of the mad love of what is no more. Everything that
has been, is fairer than the thing that is! Remembrance
has more power over my soul than hope...."
</p><p>
Julian was silent, and with a smile on his lips looked
into the distance, his head leaning back against the
column.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
</p><p>
"You speak as a poet," answered Oribazius. "But
the dreams of a poet are perilous when the fate of a
world is in his hands. Ought not he who reigns over
men to be something more than a poet?"
</p><p>
"Whose life is higher?"
</p><p>
"That of the creator of a <i>new</i> life?..."
</p><p>
"New! new!" exclaimed Julian. "To be plain
with you, your novelty sometimes strikes terror into
me! It seems to me to be cold and hard as death. I
tell you, my heart is in antiquity. The Galileans,
like you, are always seeking novelty and stamping the
old idols under foot!... Trust me, new life lies only
in what is old; immortal is it and proud, however it be
thus insulted!"
</p><p>
He drew himself up to his full height, pale and
haughty, his eyes brilliant&mdash;
</p><p>
"They think that Hellas is dead!... And from
every quarter of the compass black monks come swooping
down, like ravens, on its marble body, and pick at
it, joyously shrieking, 'Hellas is dead!' But they
forget that Hellas cannot die, that Hellas is in our
hearts! Hellas is the divine beauty of man upon
earth. She but slumbers, and when she shall awake,
woe to the crows of Galilee!"
</p><p>
"Julian," murmured Oribazius, "I fear for you....
You wish to accomplish the impossible....
Crows do not feed on the living, and the dead do not
rise again.... Ah, Cæsar! what if the miracle does
not succeed?"
</p><p>
"I have no fear. My defeat shall be my victory!"
exclaimed the Emperor, with so radiant a happiness on
his young face that Oribazius was thrilled, as if the
miracle was now to be achieved. "Glory to the rejected!
Glory to the conquered! But before my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
destruction," he added with a proud smile, "we will
fight a good fight!... I would that my enemies
were worthy of my hate, and not of my contempt!...
In truth I love my enemies. They teach me to feel
and measure my own force! They bring into my heart
the gaiety of Dionysus. Or it shall be the old Titan,
snapping his chains, and kindling anew the Promethean
fire! Titan against Galilean!... Rejoice, tribes
and peoples of the earth! I am the messenger of life
who shall set you free! I <i>am</i> the Anti-Christ!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">III</h2>

<p>In the neighbouring monastery, behind windows and
doors closely sealed, solemn prayers of the religious
were resounding above the distant noise of Bacchic
chants. To drown them the monks joined their voices
in shrill lamentation&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Why, Lord, hast Thou abandoned us? Why has
Thy anger fallen upon Thy sheep?</i>
</p><p>
"<i>Why hast Thou given us up in dishonour to the hand of the heathen?</i>
</p><p>
"<i>Why hast Thou let mankind do outrage unto Thee?</i>"
</p><p>
The ancient words of the prophet Daniel took on an
unwonted meaning&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>The Lord has delivered us to the evil king, the cunningest
in all the earth!...</i>"
</p><p>
Late in the night, when the sun had sunk upon the
streets, the monks went back to their cells.
</p><p>
Brother Parphenas could not even think of sleeping.
His face was pale and gentle, and in his great eyes,
clear as a maiden's, perplexity was visible when he
spoke about worldly matters.
</p><p>
He spoke rarely, indistinctly, and in a fashion so
quaint, on topics so childish, that it was difficult to
hear him without smiling. Sometimes he laughed
without cause; and austere monks would say to him&mdash;
</p><p>
"What are you cackling at? Is it to please the
Devil?"
</p><p>
Then he would timidly explain that he was laughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
at his own thoughts, and thus convince everybody
that Parphenas was mad.
</p><p>
One great art he possessed&mdash;that of illuminating
manuscripts; and this art of Brother Parphenas
brought to the monastery not only money, but renown
in the most distant provinces. Of this he had no suspicion,
and if he had been able to understand what
reputation means, would rather have been dismayed
than delighted.
</p><p>
His artistic occupations, which cost him vast pains
(Brother Parphenas pushed perfection of detail to an
exquisite finish), were not in his eyes a labour, but an
amusement. He never said, "I'm going to work."
But he always asked of the old Father Superior Pamphilus,
who loved him tenderly, "Father, give me
your blessing, I am going to play."
</p><p>
And when he had mastered some difficult combination
of ornament, he would clap his hands in self-congratulation.
Brother Parphenas so enjoyed the
solitude and calm of night that he had learned to work
by lamp-light. He used to say that the colours took
on unexpected shades, and that the yellow light did
no harm to drawings in the realm of pure fancy.
</p><p>
In his narrow cell Parphenas lighted the earthen
lamp and placed it on a plank, among his little flasks,
fine brushes, and colour-boxes of vermilion, silver, and
liquid gold. He crossed himself cautiously, dipped his
brush, and began to paint the outspread tails of two
peacocks above a frontispiece. The golden peacocks,
on a green field, were drinking at a streamlet of turquoise,
with raised beaks and outstretched necks.
Other rolls of parchment lay by him, unfinished. His
world was a supernatural and charming world. Bordering
the text of the page ran an embroidery of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
fabulous creations; a faery architecture of fantastic
trees and animals. Parphenas thought of nothing
while he created these things, but a happy serenity
transformed his face. Hellas, Assyria, Persia, the
Indies, Byzantium idealised, and the troubled vision
of future worlds, of all peoples, and of all ages; these
mingled in the paradise of the monk, and shone, with
a glitter as of jewels, round the initial letters of the
holy books.
</p><p>
This one represented the Baptism. St. John was
pouring water on the head of Christ, and at his elbow
the Pagan god of rivers was amiably tilting a water-jar,
while the former proprietor of the bank (that is to
say, the Devil) held a towel in readiness to offer the
Saviour after the ceremony.
</p><p>
Brother Parphenas in his innocence had no fear of
the old gods. They used to amuse him. He regarded
them as long ago converted to Christianity. He never
failed to place the god of mountains, in the shape of a
naked youth, on the summit of every hill. When he
was drawing the passage of the Red Sea, a woman
holding an oar symbolised the Sea, and a naked man,
inscribed Bodos, stood for the Abyss engulfing Pharaoh,
while on the bank sat a melancholy woman, in a tan-coloured
tunic, denoting the Desert.
</p><p>
Here, there, and everywhere, in the curve of a horse's
neck, the fold of a robe, the simple pose of a god lying
on his elbow, were evidences of antique grace and
simplicity.
</p><p>
But on this night his "play" interested the artist
no more. His tireless fingers were shaky, and the
smile had left his lips.
</p><p>
Listening awhile, he opened a cedar-wood box, took
out an awl used in the binding of books, crossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
himself, and shielding the ruddy flame of the lamp with
his hand, noiselessly issued from his cell. It was hot
in the silent corridor. No sound was heard but the
buzzing of a fly taken in a spider's web.
</p><p>
Parphenas went down to the church, which was
lighted by a single lamp, placed before the old ivory-carved
diptych. Two large sapphires in the aureole of
Jesus, who was sitting on the Virgin's arm, had been
carried off by the Pagans, and transferred to their
original setting in the Temple of Dionysus. These
black hollows in the yellow ivory were to Parphenas
wounds in some living body.
</p><p>
"No, I cannot bear it," he murmured, kissing the
hand of the Infant Jesus. "I cannot bear it; 'twould
be better to die!"
</p><p>
These sacrilegious marks in the ivory tortured and
angered him more than outrage on a human being.
</p><p>
In a corner of the church he discovered a rope-ladder,
used in lighting chapel-lamps. Carrying this
ladder he went forth into a narrow passage leading to
the outer gate, in front of which the fat brother-cellarer,
Chorys, was snoring on the straw. Parphenas glided
past like a shadow. The lock of the door made a
grinding noise. Chorys sat unblinking, and then
rolled round on the straw.
</p><p>
Parphenas leapt over a low wall and found himself
in the deserted street, into which the full moon was
shining. There was a low roar of the sea. The young
monk went along the Temple of Dionysus up to a point
in which the wall was plunged in shadow. Thence he
threw up the rope-ladder, so that it hooked itself to the
metal pinnacle which decorated the corner. The ladder
swung from the claw of a sphinx. The monk clambered
by it to the roof.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
</p><p>
Far off, cocks crew; a dog barked; and then again
came silence, measured only by the slow sighings of
the sea.
</p><p>
Parphenas threw the ladder down the inner wall of
the temple, and descended.
</p><p>
The eyes of the god, two lengthy sapphires, shone
with intense vividness in the moonlight, gazing down
on the monk. Parphenas, thrilled by the silence,
trembled and crossed himself. He clambered on to the
altar where Julian had offered the sacrifice, and his
heels felt the warmth of the half-extinguished embers.
</p><p>
The monk drew the awl from his pocket. The god's
eyes sparkled close to his face, and the artist felt the
careless smile of Dionysus, and the lovely pose of the
body. Even while digging out the sapphires, his admiring
hand involuntarily spared the body of the
marble tempter.
</p><p>
Finally the deed was done. The blinded Dionysus
stared horribly on the monk from his hollow orbits.
Terror fairly seized Parphenas. It seemed that he was
watched. He leapt down from the altar, ran to the
rope-ladder, climbed, threw it down the other side of
the wall, without taking time to fix it properly. This
cost him a fall during the latter part of the descent.
</p><p>
With crimson face, and clothes ragged and disordered,
but griping the precious sapphires, he slunk
furtively across the street, and ran to the monastery.
</p><p>
The porter did not wake, and Parphenas furtively
entered the chapel. At the sight of the diptych, his
mind grew calm again. He tried the sapphire eyes of
Dionysus into the holes. They fitted admirably, and
soon were glittering anew in the aureole of the Infant
Jesus. He returned to his cell, lit the lamp, and went
to bed. Huddling himself up, and hiding his face in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
his hands, he burst into a fit of muffled laughter, like
a child delighted at some piece of mischief and afraid
of discovery. He then straightway fell sound asleep.
</p><p>
When he awoke, the morning waves of the Propontic
were shining through the small barred window, and the
pigeons cooing and shaking their wings.
</p><p>
The laughter of the previous night was still in the
heart of Parphenas. He ran to the painting-table and
contentedly looked at his unfinished arabesque of the
Earthly Paradise. Adam and Eve were seated in a
meadow, glittering in the sunlight; it was a vellum
tapestry of purple, blue, and gold. And so the little
monk worked on, innocently investing the body
of Adam with the proud antique beauty of young
Dionysus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">IV</h2>

<p>The celebrated sophist, Hekobolis, Court professor
of eloquence, had begun to climb the ladder of
promotion at the very lowest rungs. He had been a
servant attached to the Temple of Astarte at Hieropolis.
At sixteen, having stolen some articles of value, he
escaped to Constantinople, lived with the dregs of the
populace, soaked in every kind of rascality. Later he
took to the high-roads, where, roving on ass-back from
village to village, he lived from hand to mouth, in
company both with respectable pilgrims and with
bands of brigands&mdash;sacrificers to Dindymene, that goddess
beloved of the people. Finally he reached the
school of Pr&oelig;res the rhetorician, and soon became a
teacher of eloquence himself.
</p><p>
During the last years of Constantine the Great, when
the Christian religion became fashionable at Court,
Hekobolis became a Christian. The clergy showed
him sympathy, but Hekobolis (though never inopportunely)
changed his form of creed as the wind blew:
from Arian he became Orthodox, from Orthodox Arian,
and every conversion raised him a step in office.
</p><p>
The clergy pushed him up this ascent, and in turn
he lent the clergy a helping hand.
</p><p>
His head grew grey; he became pleasantly corpulent,
his sage speeches more and more honeyed and
insinuating, his cheeks more rosy, his eyes more kindly
and brilliant. At moments an evil irony sparkled in
them, as of some cold and arrogant spirit, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
eyelids would promptly drop and the sparkle vanish. All
his habits were clerical. He was a strict observer of
fasts, and an exquisite judge of cookery. His lean
diet was more refined than the most sumptuous course
of holiday feeding; just as his ecclesiastical witticisms
were keener than the frankest pleasantries of the
Pagans. He used to be served with a cooling drink
made of beetroot and savoured with delicious spices.
Many thought it preferable to wine. When denied
ordinary wheaten bread he invented cakes of a desert
manna, with which, it is said, Pachomius fed himself
in Egypt. Ill-natured folk insinuated that Hekobolis
was a libertine, and quaint tales were told about him at
Constantinople. A young woman avowed to her confessor
that she had fallen from chastity&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is a great sin! And with whom were you guilty,
my daughter?" "With Hekobolis, father!" The
priestly visage cleared up. "With Hekobolis; ah,
really! Well, well, the holy man is devoted to the
Church! Repent, my daughter; the Lord will forgive!"
</p><p>
Such anedoctes were mere tittle-tattle. But his thick
red lips were a trifle too prominent in the respectable
shorn visage of the dignitary, although he usually kept
them tightly closed, with an expression of monastic
humility. Women were fond of his company.
</p><p>
Sometimes Hekobolis used to disappear for several
days. No one fathomed the mystery, for he kept his
own counsel. Neither servant nor slave accompanied
him on these enigmatic journeys, from which he would
return calmed and refreshed.
</p><p>
Under the Emperor Constantius, he received the appointment
of Court rhetorician, with a superb salary,
the senatorial laticlave, and the blue shoulder-ribbon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
a distinction of the highest dignitaries. Nor was his
ambition satisfied.
</p><p>
But at the moment when Hekobolis was preparing
to mount a step higher, Constantius unexpectedly died.
Julian, the Church's enemy, ascended the throne.
Hekobolis lost no whit of his presence of mind. He
merely did what many others were doing, but did it
neither too soon nor too late.
</p><p>
Julian, in the first days of his reign, organised a theological
controversy in his palace. A young doctor of
philosophy, esteemed by everybody for his uprightness
and noble nature, Cæsar of Cappadocia,&mdash;brother of the
famous theologian, Basil the Great,&mdash;undertook the defence
of the Christian faith against the Emperor himself.
</p><p>
In such tournaments of learning Julian authorised an
entire independence of language, and even liked to be
answered with passion and complete disregard of rank.
</p><p>
Discussion was of the keenest kind, and considerable
numbers of sophists, priests, and men of science were
present. Usually the opponent little by little gave
way, yielding, not to the logic of the Greek philosopher,
but to the majesty of the Roman Emperor.
</p><p>
But on this occasion it was not so. Cæsar of Cappadocia
did not yield. He was a young man, almost
feminine in the grace of his movements, and with a
steady clearness in his frank eyes. He denominated
the Platonic philosophy "the tortuous wisdom of the
serpent," contrasting it with the heavenly wisdom of
the Gospel. Julian frowned, bit his lips, bridling his
anger with difficulty. The argument, like all sincere
discussions, ended without results, and the Emperor,
recovering his self-possession, quitted the hall with
a philosophic jest, and a face of smilingly regretful
magnanimity; in reality, pierced to the heart.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
</p><p>
Precisely at this moment, Hekobolis, the rhetorician,
came up. Julian, who considered him an enemy, asked
him&mdash;
</p><p>
"What do you want?"
</p><p>
Hekobolis fell on his knees, and began a confession
of repentance. For long, he said, he had hesitated;
but the reasonings of the Emperor had finally convinced
him. He cursed the dark Galilean superstition,
and his heart returned to the remembrance of his
childhood and the bright gods of Olympus.
</p><p>
The Emperor raised the old man, and, scarcely able
to speak with emotion, pressed him convulsively to his
bosom, and kissed him on his shaven cheeks and thick
red lips. His eyes sought out Cæsar of Cappadocia to
feast on his opponent's humiliation.
</p><p>
Julian kept Hekobolis near him for several days,
repeating everywhere the story of his conversion, proud
of his disciple as a child of a new toy, as a youth of his
first mistress.
</p><p>
The Emperor desired to give some Court place of
honour to his new friend, but Hekobolis flatly refused,
alleging himself to be unworthy such distinction. He
had decided to prepare his soul for the virtue of the
Olympians by a long novitiate; and to purge his heart
of Galilean impiety by personal service to one of the
old gods.
</p><p>
Julian therefore nominated him chief sacrificial priest
of Bithynia and Paphlagonia.
</p><p>
Persons bearing this title were called by the Pagans
Archiepiscopts. The Archbishop Hekobolis thus
governed two Asiatic provinces. Having taken the
new way, he pursued it with as much success as the
old, and even contributed to the conversion of many
Christians to Hellenism.

</p><p>
Hekobolis became the high-priest to the celebrated
Ph&oelig;nician goddess, Astarte Atargatis, where in childhood
he had served as a slave. This temple was built
half-way between Chalcedon and Nicomedia, on a lofty
promontory running out into the Propontic Sea. The
place was called Gargarus. Pilgrims came thither from
all corners of the earth to adore Aphrodite Astarte,
goddess of life and love.

<h2 class="p2">V</h2>

<p>In one of the halls of his palace at Constantinople
Julian was busy with affairs of state.
</p><p>
Between the porphyry columns on the terrace, looking
out on the Bosphorus, lay a sparkling view of the pale
blue sea. The young Emperor was seated at a round
marble table, covered with papyri and rolls of parchment.
Silentiaries of the palace stooped over the table,
scribbling audibly with reed-pens. Some had a sleepy
expression, not being accustomed to get up at such an
early hour. Standing a little aloof, behind the colonnade,
two men were exchanging observations in a low
voice. These were Hekobolis and Julius Mauricus, an
official with an intelligent, bilious countenance. This
elegant Court sceptic, amidst general superstition, was
one of the last admirers of Lucian, the satirist of Samos,
author of stinging dialogues, in which he railed so pitilessly
at all the idols of Olympus and Golgotha, every
tradition of Greece and Rome. Julian was dictating
a document to the chief priest of Galicia, Arsacius&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do not allow the sacrificial priests to frequent the
theatre, to drink in taverns, or follow low trades. Respect
the obedient, punish the unfaithful. In every
town cause guest-houses to be built for pilgrims, who
should therein find ample charity. Not only for Hellenist
pilgrims, but for all, to whatever profession of
faith they may belong. We ordain to be distributed
in Galicia thirty thousand measures of wheat, a hundred
and twenty thousand gallons of wine. Distribute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
a fifth part amongst the poor living near the temple,
the rest amongst pilgrims and the sick. It is shameful
that the Hellenists starve, when the Jews have not a
beggar amongst them and the Galileans feed both their
own poor and ours. They act like those who entice
children with sweetmeats, beginning by hospitality,
inviting to feasts of brotherly love. Little by little
they finish by fasts, flagellations, madness, deaths of
martyrs, and the horror of hell. Such are the customary
means of those enemies of the human race who
call themselves Christians and brothers. Combat them
by charity, given in the name of the eternal Olympian
gods. Announce in all cities and villages that such is
my heartfelt will. If I learn that you have acted according
to my decree, my favour shall be with you.
Explain to the citizens that I hold myself in readiness
to come to their help at any moment in all circumstances.
But if they desire to obtain my favours, let
them bow before Dindymene, the great Cybele, mother
of the gods, and let them give glory unto her throughout
all peoples, throughout all time."
</p><p>
He wrote the concluding words with his own hand.
</p><p>
Breakfast was served&mdash;bread, cheese, fresh olives,
and a light white wine. Julian ate and drank without
ceasing work. But suddenly he turned and pointing to
the golden plate of olives, asked his favourite slave,
who had been brought by him from Gaul, and invariably
served him at table&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why this gold plate? Where is the other in
earthenware?"
</p><p>
"Pardon, sire!... it is broken."
</p><p>
"Broken to pieces?"
</p><p>
"No&mdash;at the edge only...."
</p><p>
"Bring it here."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
</p><p>
The slave ran to get the plate in question.
</p><p>
"It can be used for a long time yet," said Julian.
</p><p>
He smiled.
</p><p>
"My friends, I have long observed that the broken
outlasts the new. I confess I have a fancy for cracked
things. They have the charm of old friends!... I
fear novelty and hate change," and he laughed
heartily at himself. "You see what philosophy lies in
a broken plate!"
</p><p>
Julius Mauricus twitched Hekobolis by the sleeve&mdash;
</p><p>
"Did you hear? That's his character! He keeps
his cracked plates and expiring gods; and that is how
a world's destiny is decided!"
</p><p>
Julian had become completely absorbed in edicts and
laws for reform.
</p><p>
In every city in the Empire it was his wish to found
schools, lectureships, debating-halls; special forms of
prayer, and philosophic sermons, refuges for the upright,
and for those who desired to devote themselves
to philanthropic meditation.
</p><p>
"What?" whispered Mauricus to Hekobolis.
"Monasteries in honour of Aphrodite and Apollo? A
new horror!"
</p><p>
"Yes, my friend, with the aid of the gods we shall
accomplish it all," concluded the Emperor. "The
Galileans want to convince the world that they have a
monopoly of brotherly love, although it belongs to all
philosophers, whatever be the gods they revere. My
task in the world is to preach a new love; a love free
and glad as the very sky of the Olympians!"
</p><p>
Julian glanced round those present, but on the faces
of his dignitaries did not find what he sought. Deputations
from the Christian professors of rhetoric and
philosophy at this moment entered the hall. An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
edict forbidding Christian teachers to give instruction
in classical eloquence had recently appeared. The
Christian grammarians had therefore to renounce
their faith or quit their schools.
</p><p>
Scroll in hand, one of these teachers approached the
Emperor. He was a little thin man with a confused
manner, bearing a strong likeness to a parrot. Two
raw and awkward pupils accompanied him.
</p><p>
"Beloved of the gods, have pity on us!"
</p><p>
Julian interrupted&mdash;
</p><p>
"What's your name?"
</p><p>
"Papirian, a Roman citizen."
</p><p>
"Well, understand, my dear Papirian, I bear no
grudge against you ... on the contrary, remain
Galilean...."
</p><p>
The old man fell at the Emperor's feet and kissed
them.
</p><p>
"Forty years have I been teaching grammar....
I know Homer and Hesiod better than anyone
else...."
</p><p>
"What do you want..." asked Augustus sternly.
</p><p>
"Sir, I have six children!... Don't rob me of my
last crust!... My pupils like me; ask them if I
teach anything harmful!"
</p><p>
Emotion prevented Papirian from continuing his
speech, and he pointed to his pupils, who, not knowing
where to put their hands, stood together staring and
blushing.
</p><p>
"No, my friends," said the Emperor gently but
firmly. "The law is just. To my mind it is absurd
that Christian teachers, in explaining Homer, should
expound away the gods of whom Homer sang. If you
believe that our wise men composed mere fables on the
subject of our gods, you should go to your churches,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
and expound Matthew and Luke!... And note,
Galileans, all is done in your own interest...."
</p><p>
One of the rhetoricians muttered&mdash;
</p><p>
"In our interest! We shall starve!"
</p><p>
"Do you not fear profanation by what is worse than
starvation&mdash;lying wisdom? You say 'Blessed are the
poor in spirit,' Be, then, poor in spirit!... Perhaps
you imagine that I am ignorant of your teaching? I
know it better than you do! I see in the Galilean
commandments depths you have never dreamed of!...
But let each take his own path. Leave us our frivolous
learning and philosophy, our poor literary
knowledge. What have these poisoned streams to do
with you? Yours is a higher wisdom! We own the
earthly kingdom, and you ... the Kingdom of
Heaven. That's no small thing for humble folk like
you!... Dialectic and logic leads to freethinking or
heresies? Be then, in good sooth, simple as children.
The ignorance of the fishermen of Capernaum is above
all the Platonic dialogues, is it not? All the wisdom
of the Galileans is summed in the word 'Believe'! Ah,
rhetoricians, if you were true Christians you would
bless our edict. At this moment, it is not your souls,
but your bodies which rebel; your bodies, which find
sweetness in sinfulness. That is all I have to say to you,
and I hope that you will learn to agree with me, and
that you will find that the Roman Emperor is more anxious
for your souls' salvation than you are yourselves!"
</p><p>
Julian calmly threaded his way through the crowd of
unhappy rhetoricians, contented with his speech, but
Papirian, still kneeling, tore his hair&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why, Queen of Heaven, dost thou suffer such things
to be?" and the two scholars, seeing their master's distress,
with clumsy fists brushed the tears from their eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VI</h2>

<p>Julian remembered the interminable conflicts between
Orthodox and Arians under Constantius at
the council of Milan, and designing to profit by that
animosity, he decided to follow the example of his
Christian predecessors and convoke an &oelig;cumenical
council.
</p><p>
On one occasion, in a private conversation, he had
declared that, instead of persecuting the Galileans, he
wished to give them full freedom of faith, and to call
back from exile Donatists, Cæcilians, Marcionists,
Montanists, and other heretics banished by the councils
of Constantine and Constantius. He thought that
there was no better means of abolishing Christianity.
</p><p>
"You will see, my friends, when all the sectaries
shall have returned, such strife will be kindled between
these brethren, that they will begin to torture each
other like birds of prey loosed from their cage into the
arena of the circus. They will bring shame upon their
Master's name more quickly and effectually than I
could by any persecutions and martyrdoms!"
</p><p>
And so Julian sent into all parts of the Empire edicts
authorising the banished to return. The wisest Galilean
teachers were at the same time invited to come to
the palace at Constantinople for a religious discussion;
but the majority of those invited were unaware of the
subject to be discussed, the wording of the letters being
skilfully vague. Guessing some trick, many,
pleading sickness, failed to present themselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
</p><p>
The blue morning sky seemed dark against the dazzling
whiteness of the double colonnade surrounding
the court known as the Atrium of Constantine. White
pigeons were fluttering here and there in the sky, with
gleeful beating of wings. In the centre of the court
stood the statue of Venus Callipyge, in warm and
beautiful marble. The monks, passing by her, turned
away, hiding their eyes, but the tender temptress remained,
for all that, in their midst. Not without
purpose had Julian chosen this situation for the Galilean
council. The dark robes of the religious appeared
blacker still, their starvation-dulled faces more
meagre. Each strove to wear an air of indifference and
presumption, feigning not to see his enemy at his
elbow, yet casting stealthy glances of curiosity and
contempt.
</p><p>
"Holy Mother of God, what is this? Whither are
we fallen?" said the old bishop Eustace, with profound
emotion. "Let me pass out, soldiers!"
</p><p>
"Gently, gently, my friend," answered the centurion
of the lance-bearers, the barbarian Dagalaïf,
politely keeping him from the door.
</p><p>
"I'm choking in this pit of heresy! let me pass!"
</p><p>
"By the will of Augustus, everybody here has come
to the council," responded Dagalaïf, inflexibly keeping
him back.
</p><p>
"But this is not a council, it is a den of thieves!"
</p><p>
Among the Galileans some more cheerful persons
began to laugh at the provincial manners and the strong
Armenian accent of Eustace, who, losing courage,
quieted down, and slipped into a corner, muttering&mdash;
</p><p>
"Lord, Lord, how have I offended Thee?"
</p><p>
Evander of Nicomedia also quickly repented of having
come and of having led thither brother Juventinus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
a disciple of Didimus, who had but newly arrived at
Constantinople.
</p><p>
Evander was one of the greatest dogmatists of his
time; a man of profound and lucid intellect. He had
lost his health, and grown prematurely old, over his
books; he was almost blind, and his short-sighted eyes
worn out with fatigue. Innumerable heresies besieged
his brain, leaving him no sleep, or tormenting him in
dreams, ever tempting him by their dread subtleties.
Evander used to collect heresies, as one might collect
jewels or scientific rarities, in an immense manuscript
entitled <i>Against Heresy</i>. He hunted for them greedily,
imagined those that might be in existence, and
the better he refuted the more he was attracted towards
them.
</p><p>
Sometimes he would entreat God to grant him
simple faith, and God would refuse him simplicity.
</p><p>
In ordinary life he was timid, simple, and offenceless
as a child. For rascals to deceive Evander was as easy
as breathing, and on this score the mockers told a hundred
stories against him. Plunged in doctrinal dreams,
the bishop continually found himself in awkward situations.
In one of these fits of abstraction he had come
to this singular council, without thinking why he went
thither, but attracted by the hope of lighting on a new
heresy. Now his face was twitching with annoyance,
and he shaded his weak eyes against the too bright
rays of the sun, longing to be back amongst his books
in his little twilight chamber.
</p><p>
Evander kept Juventinus at his side, and warned him
against temptation by criticising various heresies. In
the centre of the hall a vigorous old man was striding
up and down. He had high cheek-bones and thick
grey hair. It was the septuagenarian bishop Purpuris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
recalled from exile by Julian. Neither Constantine
nor Constantius had succeeded in stifling the Donatist
heresy. For fifty years past streams of blood had
flowed in Africa, by reason of the unjust deposition of
a Donatist in favour of a Cæcilian, or of a Cæcilian in
favour of a Donatist. Nor could any augury be made
as to the final issue of this fratricidal strife.
</p><p>
Juventinus noticed that the Cæcilian bishop who was
passing in front of Purpuris brushed the vestments of
the Donatist with the corner of his chasuble. The
latter turned fiercely round, with a growl of disgust,
and, taking the stuff between two fingers, shook it
several times before the eyes of everybody.
</p><p>
Evander informed Juventinus in a low voice that
when a Cæcilian happened to enter a Donatist congregation
he was hunted out and the flags touched by
his feet were washed with salt water.
</p><p>
Behind Purpuris, dogging him step by step, walked
his faithful bodyguard, an enormous half-savage African,
brown-skinned, terrible, flat-nosed, and thick-lipped,
the deacon Leona. He was armed with a
cudgel, gripped tightly in his nervous hands. He was
an Ethiopian peasant, belonging to the self-mutilating
sect called Circumcellions. Weapon in hand, these sectaries
would run along the high-roads offering money
to passers-by, in return for destruction, adding, "Kill
us, or we will kill you!" In the name of Christ the
Circumcellions mutilated themselves, burned themselves,
drowned themselves, but never would hang
themselves, because Judas was hanged. They declared
that suicide for God's glory washed all sin from the
soul, and the people looked on them as martyrs. Before
death, they abandoned themselves to all pleasures;
ate, drank, and offered violence to women. A great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
number refrained from using swords, Christ having
forbidden it, but on the other hand they felled heretics
and pagans with huge bludgeons, "according to the
Scriptures," and with consciences at ease. While
spilling blood they would cry "Glory be to God!"
</p><p>
And the peaceful inhabitants lived more in terror of
this religious cry than of war-trumpets or the roarings
of a lion. The Donatists considered the Circumcellions
as their guardians, and these Ethiopian peasants finding
theological controversies hard to understand, the
Donatists would point out beforehand those whom they
were to strike according to the Scriptures.
</p><p>
Evander directed the attention of Juventinus on a
handsome youth, whose tender and ingenuous expression
seemed almost that of a young girl. He was a
Caïnite.
</p><p>
"Blessed be our tameless brothers, Cain, Shem, the
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah!" preached the
Caïnites. "They are seeds of high wisdom, of reason
divine!... Come to us, all ye hunted, reprobate,
revolted! Blessed be Judas! he alone among the
apostles was initiated in the higher knowledge!...
He betrayed Christ that He might die and rise again,
because he knew the death of Christ would save the
world! He who is initiated in our wisdom can transgress
all limits, daring all, despising matter, trampling
all fear under foot; and giving himself up to all sins
and delight of the sense, attain that disgust for matter
which is the final purity of the soul!"
</p><p>
"Look, Juventinus, there is a man who believes
himself above archangels and seraphim," said Evander,
waving his hand towards a young and sprightly Egyptian,
who held himself aloof from everyone, an ironic
smile on his lips, which were painted, like those of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
courtesan. He was dressed in the latest Byzantine
vogue, his white hands loaded with rings. His name
was Cassiodorus, and he was a Valentinian. "In the
Christians," affirmed the arrogant Valentinians, "there
is a soul, as in animals; but there is no mind, as in us.
We alone are initiated into the mysteries of the Gnosis
and of the divine Plenum. It follows, therefore, that
we alone are worthy to call ourselves human. All
others are, as it were, pigs and dogs."
</p><p>
Cassiodorus would say to his disciples: "You should
know everyone, but no one should understand you.
Before the profane, deny the Gnosis, be dumb, and despise
evidences of the gospel. Despise professions of
faith and martyrdoms; love silence and mystery. Be
for your enemy as invisible, elusive, inviolable, as the
immaterial forces. Ordinary Christians need good
actions for their salvation; but those who possess the
highest knowledge of God, the Gnosis, need not perform
these actions. We are the sons of light, they the
sons of darkness. We fear not sin, because we know
that sin is needful to the material body, and even to
the immaterial soul. We are placed so high that, let
our faults be what they will, we cannot err. Our heart
remains chaste in the delights of matter, as pure gold
keeps its brightness in the mud."
</p><p>
Elsewhere Juventinus saw an old man, with a hang-dog
expression and a squint, the Adamite Prodick,
explaining his teaching in a loud voice. He believed
in restoring the innocence of the first Adam. The
Adamites performed their mysteries in a church warmed
like a bath and called the "Eden." Like our first
ancestors, they evinced no shame in the absence of
clothes, and assevered that among themselves all men
and women were noted for lofty modesty, although the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
innocence of these paradisiac assemblies had sometimes
been questioned.
</p><p>
At the elbow of the Adamite Prodick a woman&mdash;pale-faced,
grey-haired, and proud, her eyes half-shut
with fatigue&mdash;was sitting on the ground. She wore
episcopal garb. She was the prophetess of the Montanists.
Yellow-skinned Copts were tending her devotedly,
gazing on her with solicitude, and calling her
"Heavenly Dove." Consuming themselves for years
in ecstasies of impossible love, they preached the duty
of bringing humanity to an end, through the practice
of continence. Scattered in numerous bands on the
burning hills of Phrygia, near the ruins of Papusa,
these pallid dreamers would remain sitting motionless,
day after day, their eyes fixed on the horizon, on
which the Saviour was to appear. On foggy evenings,
above the grey plain, in the clouds, in rays of melting
gold they would catch visions of the glory of God&mdash;the
new Zion descending upon earth. Year after year
they would wait, dying at last in the hope that the
celestial kingdom was just about to descend upon the
ruins of Papusa. Sometimes lifting her wearied eyelids,
and with troubled gaze fixed in the distance, the
prophetess was murmuring in Syriac&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Maran Atha</i>"&mdash;"The Lord is coming!"
</p><p>
And her Coptic servants bowed towards her, the
better to hear.
</p><p>
Juventinus listened to the explanations of Evander.
All this resembled some wild and torturing dream.
His heart shivered, under a bitter flood of pity.
</p><p>
Silence was at last restored; all looks turned towards
the same spot, at the opposite extremity of the court,
where Julian was standing. His face was clear and
firm, and he wore an air of assumed indifference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
His garb was the simple white chlamys of the philosophers.
</p><p>
"Old men and masters," said Augustus, addressing
the assembly, "we have thought it well to give evidence
of our indulgence and compassion to all our
subjects who profess the Galilean teaching. For those
who are gone astray it is better to feel compassion than
hatred; better to lead the obstinate to the truth by exhortation,
and in no wise by harryings, blows, or corporeal
tortures. Wishing to restore peace to the world,
so long troubled by religious discord, I have called you,
O learnéd Galileans, together. We shall hope that
under our protection you will give an example of those
lofty virtues which befit your wisdom and your spiritual
divinity."
</p><p>
So, with the easy gestures of a practised speaker, he
began a speech prepared beforehand. But the benevolent
words were not lacking in ironic allusion.
</p><p>
He made it clear he had not forgotten the stupid
and coarse altercations that had taken place under
Constantius, at the council of Milan. He mentioned,
with an evil smile, those audacious persons who, regretting
that they were no longer allowed to persecute
or martyrise their brethren, had urged the ignorant
populace into rebellion, poured oil on fire, and attempted
to fill the world with fratricidal madness.
These were the real enemies of humanity, and guilty of
the greatest evil of all, namely, anarchy.
</p><p>
And he finished his harangue by the following unexpected
words&mdash;
</p><p>
"We have called back from banishment your brothers,
who had been hunted forth from the councils of
Constantine and Constantius, because we desired to give
liberty to all citizens of the Roman Empire. And for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the complete suppression of discord, we confide to you,
wise teachers, the duty of settling for Galileans a
single and unique profession of faith. It is to this end
that we have convoked you in our palace. Judge now,
and authoritatively decide. In order to afford you full
freedom of speech we will withdraw, and await your
wise decision."
</p><p>
Before anyone had time to grasp the situation, or to
answer this strange discourse, Julian, surrounded by
his philosophic friends, left the court and disappeared.
</p><p>
Everybody was dumb. Someone uttered a long
sigh, and in the general silence the beating of pigeons'
wings and the rippling of the fountain alone were
audible. Suddenly, on the raised marble daïs, which
had served as tribune for Julian, appeared the kindly
old man at whose provincial bearing and Armenian
accent everybody had laughed.
</p><p>
His face was red, his eyes burning with vehemence.
The Emperor's speech had offended the old bishop.
Filled with fearless religious zeal, Eustace advanced
towards the members of the council&mdash;
</p><p>
"Fathers and brothers," he exclaimed, and his
voice was so stern and unshaken that no one thought
of laughing at it&mdash;"Fathers and brothers, let us part
in peace! He who has called us here, to seduce and
to insult us, knows neither the canons of the Church
nor the rules of the councils. He hates even the name
of Jesus! Let us not be a sport to our enemies, let us
restrain all angry words! I entreat you, in the name
of the eternal God, let us separate in silence!"
</p><p>
He pronounced these words in a loud and ringing
voice, his eyes fixed on a raised gallery, curtained by
purple hangings. The Emperor, surrounded by his
Hellenist friends, had just appeared there. A murmur
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
of fright and astonishment ran through the assembly.
Julian gazed at Eustace, but the old man sustained his
gaze. The Emperor's face grew dark.
</p><p>
At that moment the Donatist Purpuris brutally
thrust off the bishop and took his place on the tribune.
</p><p>
"Do not listen to him," cried Purpuris; "do not let
us separate, in scorn of the will of Augustus! The
Cæcilians bear a grudge against him, because he has
delivered us."
</p><p>
"No, in all truth, no, my brothers!" protested
Eustace.
</p><p>
"Leave us, ye accursed! We are not your brothers!
We are the wheat-ears of God&mdash;you the straw destined
for the burning!..." And waving his hand
towards the apostate Emperor Purpuris continued in
a solemn tone, as if chanting a nuptial song&mdash;
</p><p>
"Behold our saviour! Look on him!... Glory,
glory, to the most compassionate and learned Augustus!...
Thou shalt trample on the snake and the
reptile! Thou shalt conquer the lion, for the angels
watch over thee in all thy doings.... Hail!"
</p><p>
The congregation became unsettled. Some declared
that the advice of Eustace must be followed. Others
asked to be heard, not wishing to lose the opportunity
of expounding their doctrines before a general religious
council. Faces kindled and voices rose.
</p><p>
"Let a Cæcilian enter one of our churches now" exulted
Purpuris, "and we'll place our hands on his head,
not to choose him as our shepherd, but to crack his
skull!"
</p><p>
Many forgot the purpose of the meeting and engaged
in subtle discussions, seeking converts. The Basilidian,
Triphon, who hailed from Egypt, surrounded by curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
hearers, exhibited a transparent chrysolith amulet,
bearing the mysterious word "Abraxa."
</p><p>
"He who shall understand the meaning of the word
<i>Abraxa</i>," Triphon was saying to the group around
him, "shall receive all freedom, shall become an immortal,
and, tasting all sins, be sullied by none.
<i>Abraxa</i> represents by letters the number of the mountains
in heaven, three hundred and sixty-five. Above
the three hundred and sixty-five celestial spheres, above
the hierarchies of angels and archangels, there is a certain
Nothingness, nameless, and more beautiful than
any light, a motionless and sterile Nothingness...."
</p><p>
"The motionless and sterile nothingness is in your
own stupid head!" growled an Arian bishop, striding
straight up to Triphon.
</p><p>
The Gnostic, according to his custom, became silent,
locking his lips in a contemptuous smile, and raising a
forefinger&mdash;
</p><p>
"Wisdom! Wisdom!" he ejaculated, and vanished
in the crowd.
</p><p>
The prophetess of Papusa, among her anxious Copts,
stood up, terrible, pale, half-swooning, and groaned, as
if her troubled eyes saw nothing, as if her ears heard
nothing&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Maran Atha</i>"&mdash;"The Lord is coming!"
</p><p>
The disciples of the youth Epiphanes, a Pagan demi-god
or Christian martyr, worshipped in the oratories of
Cephalonia, were declaiming brotherhood and equality&mdash;
</p><p>
"There are no laws but these: Destroy all; let all be
in common&mdash;women, lands, riches, like earth, air, and
sun!"
</p><p>
The Ophites, serpent-worshippers, raised above their
heads a cross, round which a tame adder was coiling&mdash;
</p><p>
"The wisdom of the Serpent," they said, "gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
man a knowledge of good and evil; behold the saviour,
Ophiomorphos, the serpentiform! Fear nothing!
Hearken to him! Taste the forbidden fruit, and ye
shall be even as gods!"
</p><p>
A perfumed and curled Marcosianist, lifting on high
a crystal cup full of water with the skilful gestures of
a juggler, invited curiosity&mdash;
</p><p>
"Look at this miracle! the water's going to boil
and be turned into blood!"
</p><p>
Colabasians were there, counting their fingers with inconceivable
celerity, and demonstrating that all the numbers
of Pythagoras, every mystery of heaven and earth,
were comprised in the letters of the Greek alphabet&mdash;
</p><p>
"Alpha, Omega&mdash;the beginning and the end, and
between them the Trinity; Beta, Gamma, Delta&mdash;the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit! You see how
simple it is!"
</p><p>
Fabionites, gluttonous Carpocratians, debauched Barbelonites
stood up, preaching such follies that hearers
possessing a vestige of morality put their fingers in their
ears. Many strove to move their audiences by the attractive
force over the imagination possessed by madness
and monstrosity. Every man was certain of his own gospel.
Yet all were enemies. Even the minute sect, hidden
in remote provinces of Africa, the Rogationists, were certain
that Christ returning upon earth would find the true
comprehension of the Gospel only amongst themselves,
in a few Mauritanian villages, and nowhere else.
</p><p>
Evander of Nicomedia, forgetting Juventinus, could
scarcely scribble down the new heresies on his tablets
fast enough, happy as a collector who has lit upon a
new set of trinkets.
</p><p>
And meantime, in the upper gallery, the young
Emperor, surrounded by his white-robed philosophic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
friends, was gazing down upon the maddened tumult
with malign satisfaction. The Pythagorean Proclus,
Nymphidian, Priscus, Ædesius, old Iamblicus, the
pious bishop Hekobolis, were at his side. They neither
laughed nor jested. Their faces remained almost impassive
and their attitude a becoming one; only from time
to time across their closed lips flitted a furtive and pitying
smile. From the shadow of the purple hangings
they looked down on the spectacle, as gods must regard
the hostilities of men, or circus-lovers the beasts of the
arena. It was indeed a banquet for Hellenic sages.
</p><p>
In the midst of the general confusion the effeminate
young Caïnite leapt on the tribune and shouted, with
such conviction in his voice that everybody turned
round, overwhelmed at the impiety&mdash;
</p><p>
"Blessed be rebels against God! Blessed be Cain,
Shem, Judas, the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah!
Blessed be their brother, the Angel of Infinite Darkness!"
</p><p>
The bishop Purpuris, who for an hour past had not
been able to get a hearing, to relieve his feelings rushed
at the Caïnite and raised his sinewy hand to close the
lips of the blasphemer.
</p><p>
A crowd dragged him back.
</p><p>
"Father, it is unbecoming!"
</p><p>
"Let me be, let me be! I will not endure such
abomination," roared Purpuris; "take this, seed of
Cain!"
</p><p>
And the bishop spat in his face.
</p><p>
A general fray followed, which would have enlarged
into a battle if Roman soldiers had not intervened.
These parted the Galileans, with the words&mdash;
</p><p>
"You must not act so in this place! Have you
not got enough churches to fight each other in?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
</p><p>
Purpuris was dragged off, and ordered to quit the
atrium.
</p><p>
He called out&mdash;
</p><p>
"Leona, deacon Leona!"
</p><p>
The deacon thrust the soldiers aside, felled two of
them to the earth, freed Purpuris, and set the terrible
mace of the Circumcellions whirling above the heads
of the heresiarchs.
</p><p>
"Glory to God!" shouted the African, seeking a
victim.
</p><p>
Suddenly the club sank out of his loosened hands.
All stood petrified. Then a sharp cry, uttered by one
of the Coptic servants of the prophetess of Papusa, rent
the general hush. Kneeling, his face transfigured by
fear, he pointed to the tribune&mdash;
</p><p>
"The Devil! The Devil! Look at the Prince of
Evil!"
</p><p>
It was Julian the Emperor, on the marble daïs above
the crowd, in his white chlamys, his arms crossed on
his breast. Terrible glee burned in his eyes; and to
many indeed, at that moment, the recreant prince appeared
dreadful as Satan, his brother.
</p><p>
"Is this how you fulfil the law of love, Galileans?"
he said to the dumbfounded assembly. "How much
your mercy and forgiveness are worth!... Verily
the wild animals have more compassion than brethren
like you! In the words of your Master: "Woe upon
you, law-makers, because you have taken the key of the
house, and, hindering others from entering, have not
entered in yourselves! Woe to you, Pharisees!..."
</p><p>
And enjoying their silence he added after a pause&mdash;
</p><p>
"If you cannot rule yourselves, Galileans, I say to
you, in order to prevent greater misfortunes, you shall
now obey, and submit yourselves to me!"

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VII</h2>

<p>Just as Julian, leaving the Atrium of Constantine,
was descending the great flight of steps and proceeding
to sacrifice in the direction of the little Temple
of Tyche, the goddess of happiness, near the palace,
the old bishop Maris, blind, white-haired, and bent
double, approached him, led by a child. A great
crowd had gathered at the foot of the staircase. With
a solemn gesture, the bishop stopped the Emperor and
said to him&mdash;
</p><p>
"Listen, peoples, tribes, young and old, all that be
upon the earth, listen to me! And ye powers above,
Angels, who will blot out soon this martyr-maker! It
is not the Amorite king who shall fall, nor Ogyges,
King of Thebes, but the Serpent, the Great Spirit, the
revolted Assyrian, the common enemy, who shall cause
a multitude of threats and violences upon earth!
Hear, O heaven, and inspire the earth!... And
thou also, Cæsar, listen to my prophecy, for to-day, by
my mouth, God speaks!... Thy days are numbered!
Soon wilt thou perish! Like dust lifted by
the tempest, like the hiss of an arrow, like the noise
of thunder, like the swiftness of light! The spring of
Castaly shall be dried up forever, and a mockery to us
that pass by! Apollo shall become again a worthless
idol, Daphne a tree bewept in fable, and the grass
shall grow in your temples overturned. O! abominations
of Sennacherib! so we have foretold it. We
Galileans&mdash;despised of the earth&mdash;adorers of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Crucified&mdash;ignorant disciples of the fishermen of Capernaum&mdash;we,
weakened by long fasting, half-dead, who
struggle in vain, we nevertheless shall overcome
you!... Unfold to me, Imperial sophist, your
speeches, your syllogisms, your antitheses; and we
shall see how, on our side, ignorant fishermen can
speak!
</p><p>
"David shall chant again&mdash;David, who with his
strange pebbles from the brook slew Goliath. Thanks
be to Thee, O Lord! the Church to-day is purified by
persecution! O pure virgins, kindle your torches,
array the bishop with a fair robe, for our ornament is
the robe of Christ!"
</p><p>
The old man almost chanted the last words as in a
liturgy, and the crowd, with emotion, murmured approval.
Someone cried out aloud&mdash;
</p><p>
"Amen!"
</p><p>
"Have you finished, old man?" asked Julian,
calmly.
</p><p>
The Emperor had listened to the long speech imperturbably,
as if it had been addressed to someone
else.
</p><p>
"Here are my hands, executioners ... bind
them!... Lead me to death!... Lord, I accept
Thy crown!"
</p><p>
The bishop raised his faded eyes skyward.
</p><p>
"Do you imagine, brave man, that I shall send you
to execution?" said Julian. "You are mistaken. I
shall bid you go in peace. In my heart there is no
anger whatever against you...."
</p><p>
"What is he saying?" the crowd asked each other.
</p><p>
"Tempt me not! I will not deny Christ. Hence,
enemy of mankind! Headsman, lead me to death!...
I am ready...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
</p><p>
"There are no headsmen here, my friend; they are
only simple good folk, like yourself. Set your mind at
rest. My existence is more wearisome and ordinary
than you imagine. I have heard you with curiosity,
for I admire eloquence, even when it is Galilean!...
And how much there was in it ... the abomination
of Sennacherib, the king of the Amorites, the stones of
David and Goliath! The style of your discourse can
scarcely be called simple. Read our Demosthenes,
Plato, and particularly Homer. These were really
simple in their words as children, or gods. Yes, Galileans,
learn the greatness of calm from them!... God,
remember, was not in the tempest but in the silence.
That is all my lesson. That is all my vengeance,
since vengeance you must have from me...."
</p><p>
"May God strike thee blind, renegade!" began
Maris.
</p><p>
"God's wrath will not give thee back sight by
striking me blind!" answered Julian.
</p><p>
"I thank God for my blindness!" exclaimed the
old man; "it does not allow me to see your damned
face, Apostate!"
</p><p>
"What spitefulness! in so frail a body! You are
always speaking of humility and love, Galileans; and
yet what hate is in every one of your words! I have
just quitted an assemblage where the Fathers of the
Church were ready to fly at each other like wild beasts.
And now comes this unbridled speech of yours! Why
this hatred? Am I not your brother? Oh, if you
knew at this moment how kindly my heart feels towards
you! May the Olympians soften your cruel and suffering
soul, poor blind man! Go in peace, and remember
that the Galileans are not the only men who can pardon!..."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
</p><p>
"Believe him not, brethren!... It is a trick, a
snare of the Serpent. God of Israel, have no mercy!"
</p><p>
Paying no attention to the curses of the old man,
Julian, in his white tunic, made his way through the
crowd with the haughty bearing of one of the old sages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VIII</h2>

<p>It was a stormy night. At rare intervals a weak
moon-ray darted between hurrying black clouds
and mingled itself strangely with the throbbings of
lightning. A warm salt-laden wind was blowing
violently. On the left shore of the Bosphorus a horseman
was approaching a lonely ruin. In immemorial
Trojan times this fortification had been used as a
watch-tower. It was now little more than a heap of
stones and half-demolished walls, overgrown by tall
grass. But at its foot a small chamber still served as
shelter to shepherds and poor travellers.
</p><p>
Tethering his horse under a dismantled doorway,
and brushing through the burdock-leaves, the rider
knocked at a low door&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is I, Meroë! Open!..."
</p><p>
An old Egyptian woman opened the door and admitted
him to the interior of the tower. The traveller
came near a torch which lighted up his face. He was
Julian the Emperor.
</p><p>
The two went out, the old woman, who knew the
place well, leading Julian by the hand. Parting the
briers and thistles she revealed a low entry in one face
of a little ravine in the cliff, and went down the steps
within. The sea lay near, and the shock of the waves
below made the cliff tremble, but arched rockwalls completely
sheltered them from the wind. The Egyptian
halted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Here, my lord, is a lamp, and the key. You must
turn it twice. The monastery-door is open. If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
meet the guardian brother, fear nothing; I have given
him money. Only make no mistake; it is in the upper
passage, the third cell to the left."
</p><p>
Julian opened the door and took a long time descending
a steep slope of huge stone-hewn steps. The tunnel
soon became a passage, so narrow that two men
could not pass each other in it. This secret way
joined the watch-tower on the opposite bank of the
chasm with a new Christian monastery.
</p><p>
Julian emerged high above the sea, but still between
steep cliffs washed by the tide. He began to climb a
narrow rocky stair by daylight. Arrived at the summit
he found a brick wall, which he climbed with some
difficulty. He found himself in the little cloistered
garden.
</p><p>
He penetrated farther into a small court, in which
the walls were hung with wild roses. The air was full
of perfume. The shutters of one of the windows on
the ground floor were not closed from within. Julian
gently opened them, and entered through the window.
A gust of imprisoned air filled his nostrils with odours of
moisture, incense, mice, medicinal herbs, and fresh apples,
with which the cautious nuns had filled their stores.
</p><p>
The Emperor went along a corridor into which
opened two rows of doors. He counted the third to
the left and softly opened it. An alabaster lamp faintly
lighted the cell. He made his breathing as noiseless
as possible.
</p><p>
A woman, dressed in the dark robe of a nun, lay
stretched upon a low bed. She must have fallen asleep
during prayer, too weary to undress. Long lashes
shadowed the pale cheeks, and the brows wore a slight
majestic frown, like the frown of the dead.
</p><p>
Julian recognised Arsinoë.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
</p><p>
She had greatly changed. Her hair alone had remained
unaltered. It was still golden brown at its
roots, and at its ends pale yellow, like honey standing
in the sun.
</p><p>
The eyelids trembled. She sighed.
</p><p>
Before Julian's remembrance arose that proud body
of the young Amazon bathed in light, dazzling as the
mellow Parthenon marbles, and, with a gesture of
irresistible love, Julian stretched out his arms to the
nun sleeping under the shadow of the tall black cross.
He murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Arsinoë!"
</p><p>
The girl opened her eyes, and gazed at him without
astonishment or fear, as if she had known he would
come. But returning to herself, she shivered, and
passed her hand over her forehead.
</p><p>
He came near her&mdash;
</p><p>
"Fear nothing; at a word from you I will go away."
</p><p>
"Why have you come?"
</p><p>
"I wished to know if indeed...."
</p><p>
"What matters it, Julian? We cannot understand
each other."
</p><p>
"Do you really believe in 'Him,' Arsinoë?"
</p><p>
She made no answer and lowered her eyes.
</p><p>
"Do you remember our night at Athens?" continued
the Emperor. "Do you remember then how
you tempted me, the Galilean monk, as now I am
tempting you? The old pride, the old force, are still
on your face, Arsinoë, and not humility, O slave of
the Galilean! Tell me the truth."
</p><p>
"I wish for power," she said in a low tone.
</p><p>
"Power! Then you still remember our compact&mdash;our
alliance?" exclaimed Julian joyfully.
</p><p>
She shook her head, with a sad smile&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
</p><p>
"Oh no! Power over the people is not worth the
labour of obtaining it. <i>You</i> have learned that!"
</p><p>
"And this is why you go forth into the desert?"
</p><p>
"Yes ... and for freedom's sake."
</p><p>
"Arsinoë, as of old, you care only for yourself!"
</p><p>
"I wish to love others as 'He' commands, but I
cannot. I detest them, and I detest myself!"
</p><p>
"Then it is better not to live!"
</p><p>
"One must conquer oneself," she said slowly.
"One must conquer in oneself not only the distaste for
death but also distaste for life, which is very difficult,
because a life like mine is much more terrible
than death. But if one succeeds in self-conquest to
the end, Life and Death become as nothing, and a
greater liberty is gained!"
</p><p>
Her fine brows were knit into a frown of indomitable
will.
</p><p>
Julian looked at her in despair.
</p><p>
"What have they made of you?" he murmured.
"You are all, all, executioners and martyrs! Why
do you keep torturing yourselves? Do you not see
that within your soul there is nothing but hate and
despair?"
</p><p>
She fixed on him eyes full of anger&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why did you come here? I never summoned
you. Go!... What matters it to me what you
think! My own thoughts and sufferings are enough
for me to bear. There is an abyss between us which
none living can cross over. You tell me that I do not
believe.... That is precisely the cause of my self-hatred.
I do not believe, but I wish to believe. Do
you understand? I wish and I shall believe. I shall
force myself. I shall torture my flesh&mdash;dry it up by
hunger and thirst, make it more unfeeling than stones.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
I will tame my intelligence, I will slay it, I will kill it,
because it is the Devil, and more seducing than any
passion. That shall be my last victory, and the best,
because it will set me free. Then I shall see if anything
will dare revolt in me and say, 'I do not believe!'"
</p><p>
She stretched her joined hands heavenward, with a
suppliant gesture&mdash;
</p><p>
"Lord, have mercy upon me! Lord, where art
Thou? Hear me, and pardon me!"
</p><p>
Julian flung himself on his knees before her, drew
her to himself, and his triumphant eyes sparkled&mdash;
</p><p>
"O girl, I see now, you are not able to leave us!
You willed it, but willed the impossible! Come!
Come now with me! To-morrow you shall be the
spouse of the Roman Emperor, mistress of the world!
I have entered this place like a thief; I shall go out
with my prey like a lion! What a victory over the
Galileans! Who can hinder us? We will dare everything,
and walk as gods!"
</p><p>
The face of Arsinoë became sad and tranquil. She
looked at Julian pityingly, without thrusting him
away&mdash;
</p><p>
"Unhappy man!... You are unhappy as I. You
yourself know not whither you wish to lead me. On
whom do you reckon? In whom put your trust?
Your gods are decaying, dead.... I will flee into
the desert, far from contaminating fables, far from this
terrifying smell of rottenness. Leave me.... I can
aid you in nothing.... Go...."
</p><p>
Wrath and passion shone in Julian's eyes; but more
calmly still, and so pityingly that his very heart
shivered and froze as under the blow of deadly insult,
she went on&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
</p><p>
"Why do you delude yourself? Are <i>you</i> not wavering,
perishable, as we all are? Think: what means
this charity of yours? These guest-houses&mdash;these
sermons of the sacrificial priests? All that is new, unknown
to the ancient heroes of Hellas.... Julian!
Julian! are <i>your</i> gods the ancient Olympians, luminous
and pitiless&mdash;terrible sons of the azure&mdash;rejoicing
in the blood of victims and in the pains of mortals?
Human blood and suffering were the very nectar of the
old gods! Yours, seduced by the faith of the fishermen
of Capernaum, are sick and humble weaklings,
full of compassion for men.... But that pity is
mortal to your gods!
</p><p>
"Yes," she continued implacably; "you are sick,
you are all too weak for your wisdom! That is your
penalty, Hellenists of too late a day. You have
strength neither for good nor for evil. You are neither
day nor night, nor life nor death; your heart wavers,
here and there. You have left one bank, and cannot
reach the other. You believe, and you do not believe.
You betray yourselves, you hesitate; you will, and you
do not will, because you do not know on what to set
your will. They alone are strong who, seeing one
truth, are blind to all other. They will conquer us&mdash;us
who are wise and weak!"
</p><p>
Julian raised his head with an effort, as if waking
from some evil dream, and said&mdash;
</p><p>
"You are unjust, Arsinoë. My soul does not know
fear, nor my will weakness. The forces of destiny are
leading me. If it is written that I shall die too soon&mdash;and
I know it is so&mdash;my death shall not be unworthy
of the sight of the gods. Farewell. I bear you no
anger, because now to me you are as one dead!"

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">IX</h2>

<p>Above the marble portico of the guest-house of
Apollo, built for the poor, for pilgrims and the
disabled, ran these letters in Homeric Greek along the
pediment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"<i>Strangers and beggars are all sent by Zeus,</i></p>
<p class="i2"><i>And dear to them is the little we give.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Emperor went into the inner court. A graceful
Ionic colonnade ran round it. The hospice had formerly
been a palæstra or wrestling-ground. It was a
soft and sunny afternoon, before sunset, but a heavy
atmosphere came to the portico from the inner rooms.
</p><p>
There, massed together, children and old men were
crawling about, Christians and Pagans, the sound and
the sick; folk disabled, deformed, enfeebled, dropsical,
consumptive; folk bearing on their faces the stamp of
every vice and every form of suffering.
</p><p>
A half-naked old woman, with a tanned skin like
the colour of dead leaves, was rubbing her sore, pockmarked
back against the pure marble of a pillar.
</p><p>
In the middle of the court stood a statue of the
Pythian Apollo, bow in hand, quiver on shoulder. At
the foot of the statue was seated a wrinkled monster
who seemed neither young nor old. His arms were
huddled round his knees, his head rested on one side;
and swinging himself from right to left with a stupid
air, he kept declaiming in a monotone&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
</p><p>
"Jesus Christ, the Son of God, have mercy upon us,
the lost, lost, lost!"
</p><p>
At last the principal inspector, Marcus Ausonius,
appeared, pale and trembling&mdash;
</p><p>
"Most wise and merciful Cæsar, will you not deign
to come into my house? The atmosphere is hurtful
here ... there are contagious maladies...."
</p><p>
"No, I am not afraid. Are you the inspector?"
</p><p>
Ausonius, keeping in his breath in order not to
breathe the vitiated air, bowed low.
</p><p>
"Are bread and wine distributed every day?"
</p><p>
"Yes, as you have ordered, divine Augustus...."
</p><p>
"What filth!"
</p><p>
"They are Galileans. To wash, is for them a sin.
It's impossible to make them take baths."
</p><p>
"Bring me the account-books!" ordered Julian.
</p><p>
The inspector fell on his knees, and for long could
not utter a word. Finally he faltered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Sire ... everything is in due order, ... but
unfortunately ... the books have been burnt...."
</p><p>
The Emperor's brow clouded.
</p><p>
At that moment, cries arose from the crowd of sick
persons&mdash;
</p><p>
"A miracle! A miracle!... Look, the paralytic
can walk!"
</p><p>
Julian turned round, and saw a tall man, wild with
joy, stretching out his hands towards him with a look
full of simple faith.
</p><p>
"I believe! I believe!" cried the paralytic; "I
believe thou art no man, but a god descended upon
earth. Touch me, heal me, Cæsar!"
</p><p>
All the halt and maimed were shouting&mdash;
</p><p>
"A miracle! Glory to Apollo! Glory to the
Healer!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
</p><p>
"Come to me," called the sick, "say a word, and I
shall be cured!"
</p><p>
Julian turned, and looked at the god in the light of
sunset, and for the first time all going on in the hospice
seemed to him a sacrilege. The clear eyes of the
Olympian should look down no more on these monstrosities.
Julian felt a wild desire to purify the ancient
palæstra, to rid it of all Pagan and Galilean vermin, to
sweep out the whole human dunghill. Oh, had Apollo
lived again, how his eyes would have lightened, his
arrows flown and purged the place of the paralytic and
infirm!
</p><p>
Julian left the hospice of Apollo in haste. The Emperor
had understood perfectly that his information
was correct and that the principal inspector was a
peculator. But such fatigue and disgust rose in his
heart that he had no courage to push further his investigation
of the rascality.
</p><p>
It was late when he returned to the palace. He
gave an order that he would receive no one, and withdrew
to the terrace which looked out on the Bosphorus.
</p><p>
Previous to his visit to the guest-house, the whole day
had worn away in wearisome details of business, legal
decisions, and the audit of accounts. A great number
of instances of peculation had been brought to light,
and allowed the Emperor to see that even his best
friends were deceiving him. All these philosophers,
these rhetoricians, poets, panegyrists, were robbing the
treasury, and robbing it just as much as had the
eunuchs and Christian bishops in the reign of Constantius.
Guest-houses, alms-houses for philosophers, inns
of Apollo and Aphrodite, were so many pretexts for
gain by the cunning, and the more so that not only to
Galileans, but also to Pagans themselves, these institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
seemed a fantastic notion, even a sacrilege, on
the part of Cæsar.
</p><p>
Julian felt his body aching under ceaseless and profitless
fatigue. Extinguishing the lamp, he lay down
upon his narrow camp-bed.
</p><p>
"I must reflect in quiet," he said to himself, gazing
at the nocturnal sky. But the power of reflection did
not come. A great star was shining in the darkened
ether and Julian through half-closed eyelids looked at
it. Coldly, coldly, the star's image sank into his heart.

<p>At Antioch the great, the capital of Syria, not far
from Syngon, the principal street, splendid hot
baths, <i>Thermæ</i>, stood just at the meeting of four roads.
</p><p>
These baths were fashionable and expensive.
Crowds of clients used to go there to learn the last
gossip of the town. Between the <i>apodyterium</i>, the
room for undressing, and the <i>frigidarium</i>, or room for
cooling and rest, lay a fine hall with mosaic floor and
marble walls; this was the hot-air bath, the <i>sudatorium</i>
or <i>laconicum</i>.
</p><p>
From adjoining halls came laughs of the bathers and
the noise of powerful jets of water falling into huge
basins. Naked slaves ran hither and thither, jostling
one another and opening jars of perfume.
</p><p>
At Antioch bathing was considered neither as an
amusement nor as a necessity, but as the principal
charm and most varied art of life. The capital of Syria
was moreover renowned, the world over, for the abundance,
the exquisite taste, and the purity of its waters.
A full bath or a full bucket seemed empty, so transparent
were the streams from the aqueducts of Antioch.
</p><p>
Through the warm and milky vapours of the sudatorium
could be caught glimpses of the red and naked
bodies of notable citizens. Some were half-reclining,
others seated. Some were being rubbed over with
oil; all, with the utmost solemnity, were talking together,
while they perspired. The beauty of a pair
of ancient statues, an Antinous and an Adonis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
placed in niches overhead, threw into still greater
prominence the hideousness of the living.
</p><p>
A fat old man came out with a majestic, albeit misshapen,
body. He was the merchant Bouzaris, whose
finger and thumb controlled the whole of the corn-markets
of Antioch. A sprightly young man was respectfully
supporting him under the arm. Although
both were naked, it was easy to distinguish at a glance
which was patron and which client.
</p><p>
"Let the vapour be turned on me," commanded
Bouzaris, in his hoarse voice. From the profundity of
his tones could be calculated the prodigious number of
millions which he commanded on the market.
</p><p>
Two metal taps were turned, and the warm steam,
escaping with a hiss from the vent-hole, enveloped the
figure of the merchant in thick mist. He stood in the
middle of the white cloud, like some squat and monstrous
god in process of apotheosis, tunding his red and
fleshy belly like a drum.
</p><p>
Sitting hard by in a prominent place was Marcus
Ausonius, the former inspector of the guest-house.
Huddled up, crouching on his heels by the massive
side of the merchant, the meagre little man resembled
a featherless and shivering chicken.
</p><p>
Julius Mauricus, the scoffer, was there, trying to
make his dry nervous body perspire. He was lean as
a stick.
</p><p>
Garguillus, too, was stretched on the mosaic floor,
still well-fed, soft as gelatine, enormous in bulk as the
carcass of a slain boar. A Paphlagonian slave, panting
under the protracted effort, was scrubbing the
blubber of his back with a piece of damp cloth; while
the now wealthy poet, Publius Porphyrius, was staring
in a melancholy manner at his own gouty legs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
</p><p>
"Do you know, my friends?" he asked, "about
the letter from the white bulls to the Roman Emperor?"
</p><p>
"No. Tell it."
</p><p>
"One line only: 'Conquer Persia, and we are
doomed!'"
</p><p>
"Is that all?"
</p><p>
"What more was there to say?"
</p><p>
Undulations of laughter heaved the body of Garguillus.
</p><p>
"By Pallas, it's telling and to the point! If the
Emperor comes back in triumph from Persia, he'll
offer in sacrifice to the Olympians such masses of white
bulls that these animals will get rarer than the bull
Apis!... Slave! Rub the small of my back, the
small of my back!... harder, harder!"
</p><p>
And, in turning over, his body made the sound,
against the mosaic floor, of a great bundle of wet linen
flopped on the ground.
</p><p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Julius, "they say from
the Isle of Taprobane, in the Indies, they're sending
great numbers of very rare white birds and big wild
swans from Scythia. All that for the gods! The
Roman Emperor is fattening the Olympians. It's
true they have had time to get hungry since the days
of Constantine!"
</p><p>
"The gods guzzle while we starve!" cried Garguillus.
"It's now three days since one has been able
to get a decent Colchis pheasant in the market, or even
a tolerably eatable fish."
</p><p>
"He's a greenhorn and an innocent!" remarked
the corn-merchant.
</p><p>
Everybody turned round respectfully.
</p><p>
"A greenhorn, I tell you!" resumed Bouzaris.
"I say that if you pinched the nose of your Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Cæsar you'd find nothing but milk in him like a babe
of two weeks!... He wanted to lower the price of
bread; forbade us to sell it at the price we set on it!
And so he brought four hundred thousand measures of
wheat from Egypt...."
</p><p>
"Well, did you lower the price?"
</p><p>
"Listen! I stirred up the wheat-sellers. We
closed the shops. Better let our grain rot than give
in. So the people ate the Egyptian corn. We won't
give him ours. He's made his cake, let him eat it!"
</p><p>
Bouzaris triumphantly clapped his palms on his
belly.
</p><p>
"That's enough steam! Now pour!" ordered
the merchant.
</p><p>
And the handsome curly-headed slave, who resembled
Antinous, unsealed over his head a slender
amphora containing the costliest Arabian cassia. The
aromatics flowed over the red sweating body. Bouzaris
spread the thick scented drops over himself with
satisfaction, and then wiped his gross fingers in the
golden hair of the slave standing with bowed head
before him.
</p><p>
"Your excellency has quite rightly observed that
the Emperor was nothing more than a greenhorn,"
said the parasite friend, with a profound bow. "He
has recently published a pamphlet aimed at the inhabitants
of Antioch and entitled, <i>The Beard-hater</i>, in
which, in response to the insults of the populace, he
says in effect&mdash;'You laugh at my beard and my coarseness
of manners. Laugh as much as you please! I,
too, laugh at myself. But I don't want trials, informers,
prisons, or punishments!' Now is that worthy
of a Roman Emperor? Is it dignified?"
</p><p>
"The Cæsar Constantius of pious memory,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
declared Bouzaris, "can't be spoken of in the same
breath with Julian! In his clothes, in his bearing, one
could see at once he was a Cæsar. But this one, God
forgive me, is only an abortion of the gods, a lame
monkey, a bandy-legged bear who hangs about the
streets unshaven, uncombed, unwashed, with stains of
ink on his fingers. Why it makes me sick to see him!...
Books, learning, philosophy.... Ah, we'll
make you pay dear for all that! A ruler mustn't
laugh with his people! He must keep them in hand.
Once let the people slip, and he'll never get a grip
on them again...."
</p><p>
Then Marcus Ausonius, who up to that time had
been mute, murmured thoughtfully&mdash;
</p><p>
"Well, one can forgive most things, but why does
he take away the last remaining joy in life&mdash;the circus,
and the fights of gladiators? My friends, the sight of
blood causes, and will always cause, an inexplicable
pleasure to man.... 'Tis a sacred and mysterious
enjoyment. There's no gaiety without bloodshed, no
greatness on the earth. The smell of blood is the smell
of Rome!"
</p><p>
The last scion of the Ausonii glanced naïvely round
at his hearers. Sometimes he looked like a boy,
sometimes like an old man. The swollen torso of
Garguillus heaved on the floor. Raising his head, he
glanced at Ausonius.
</p><p>
"Neatly put. Smell of blood, smell of Rome!...
Go on, Marcus, you're inspired to-day...."
</p><p>
"I say what I feel, my dear fellows. Blood is so
pleasant to man that even the Christians can't do without
it. They want to purify the world through bloodshed.
Julian is making a great mistake. In taking
away the circus from the people he's robbing them of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
their chief enjoyment, which is naturally sanguinary.
The populace would have pardoned almost anything;
but it won't pardon that!"
</p><p>
Marcus pronounced the last words solemnly, and
then suddenly slipped a hand behind his back and his
face beamed.
</p><p>
"Are you perspiring!" asked Garguillus.
</p><p>
"Yes!" answered Ausonius, with a rapturous smile.
"Rub, slave, rub!"
</p><p>
He lay down on the couch. The bath-slave fell to
kneading the poor anæmic limbs, which had a deadly
bluish tint.
</p><p>
From their porphyry niches the figures of ancient
time looked down with scorn through the milky
smoke.
</p><p>
Meanwhile at the cross-roads, outside the baths, a
crowd was collecting.
</p><p>
At night Antioch glittered with thousands of lights,
especially along the Syngon, which ran through the
city for a distance of twenty-six stadia, with porticoes
and colonnades thronged with shops throughout its
length.
</p><p>
In the crowd, pleasantries about the Emperor ran
from mouth to mouth. Street boys rushed about from
group to group shouting satirical ditties. An old
woman caught one of the little vagabonds, and, lifting
his shirt, administered sound correction with the sole
of her sandal.
</p><p>
"Take that! and that! to teach you to sing such
disgraceful things!"
</p><p>
The urchin uttered piercing squeals.
</p><p>
Another, clambering on the back of a comrade, drew
on the white wall with a piece of coal a long-bearded
goat, crowned with the Imperial diadem, while a third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
wrote underneath in big letters, "This is the impious
Julian!" and trying to make his voice formidable
yelled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The butcher comes<br />
With a big, big knife!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An old man in the long black ecclesiastical habit
passing by, halted, listened to the boy, and cast up his
eyes to heaven&mdash;
</p><p>
"Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings proceedeth
wisdom! Were we not better off under Cappa
and Khi?"
</p><p>
"What do you mean by Cappa and Khi?"
</p><p>
"Don't you understand? The Greek letter Cappa
(<i>&Kappa;</i>) begins the name of Constantius, and Khi (<i>&Chi;</i>) is
the initial of 'Christ.' I mean by that, that Constantius
and Christ did no harm to the inhabitants of
Antioch while the philosophers...."
</p><p>
"True, true! One was better off under Cappa and
Khi!"
</p><p>
A drunken man, overhearing this colloquy, hawked
the saying about the streets, and the pleasantry circulated
through Antioch, and being manifestly absurd
tickled the popular fancy.
</p><p>
A scene of still greater animation might have been
witnessed in the tavern situated opposite the baths.
This tavern belonged to the Armenian Syrax, who had
long ago transferred his commercial undertakings from
Cæsarea to Antioch. From bulging wine-skins and
enormous jars, wine was pouring freely into tin cups.
Here, as everywhere, the conversation turned on the
Emperor's doings.
</p><p>
The little Syrian soldier Strombix, the same who
had taken part in Julian's campaign against the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
barbarians in Gaul, was distinguishing himself by special
eloquence. By his side lolled the faithful giant, his
friend, the Sarmatian, Aragaris. Strombix felt as
happy as a fish in water; he loved risings and rebellions
better than anything in the world.
</p><p>
He was preparing to make a speech. An old rag-picker
had just brought in a sensational piece of news&mdash;
</p><p>
"We're all doomed!... The Lord's hand is
heavy on us.... Yesterday a neighbour of mine
told me something which at first I refused to believe!"
</p><p>
"Tell us, good woman!"
</p><p>
"Well, it was at Gaza. The Pagans seized a convent.
They made the nuns come out. They tied
them to gallows in the market-place, beat 'em to death,
and after rolling their warm bodies, all hacked to
pieces, in grains of barley, threw 'em to the swine!"
</p><p>
"I saw myself," added a young weaver, "a Pagan at
Hieropolis, who was eating the liver of a deacon!"
</p><p>
"What an abomination!" murmured the auditors
crossing themselves.
</p><p>
With the help of Aragaris, Strombix clambered on
to a table, which was still sticky with the spilth of
wine, and striking an oratorical attitude, addressed the
crowd, while Aragaris proudly contemplated his
friend.
</p><p>
"Citizens," began Strombix; "how long shall we
wait before we rebel? Don't you know that Julian
has sworn, if he returns a conqueror from Persia, to
gather together the holy defenders of the Church and
throw them to beasts in the amphitheatre? To turn the
porticoes of basilicas into granaries, and the churches
into stables...."
</p><p>
A hump-backed old man, livid with fear, tumbled
over on the tavern floor. It was the husband of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
rag-picker, himself a glass-blower. Rising, he slapped
his thigh despairingly, stared at the company, and
faltered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah, what a situation!... And there are two
hundred corpses in the wells and the aqueducts!"
</p><p>
"Where? What corpses?"
</p><p>
"Hush!... Hush!" murmured the glass-blower.
</p><p>
"They say that the renegade has long taken his auguries
from the intestines of living men; and all this for
his war against the Persians and his victory over the
Christians!"
</p><p>
Overcome with satisfaction he muttered under his
breath&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why, in the cellars of the palace at Antioch
they've discovered chests full of human bones ...
and in the city of Karra, near Edessa, the Christians
have found, in a subterranean temple, the corpse of a
woman hanging by her hair with her body slit open....
Julian wanted to inspect the liver of an infant
for his cursed war."
</p><p>
"Eh? Gluturius! Is it true that human bones are
found in the sewers? <i>You</i> ought to know!" said a
shoemaker, a confirmed sceptic.
</p><p>
Gluturius, the scavenger, who stood near the door,
not venturing in because he smelt badly, being thus
addressed, began, according to his custom, to smile
and to blink his inflamed eyelids:
</p><p>
"No, worthy friends," he answered humbly. "Newborn
infants are sometimes found there, or skeletons
of asses and camels, but I never yet saw a corpse of
man or woman."
</p><p>
When Strombix resumed his speech, the scavenger
listened religiously, rubbing his bare leg against the
door post.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
</p><p>
"Brother men," cried the orator, with fiery indignation,
"let us be revenged! Let us die like ancient
Romans!"
</p><p>
"No use bursting <i>your</i> lungs," grumbled the shoemaker.
"When we get to that stage, you'll be the
first to turn tail and let the others die!"
</p><p>
"You're a set of cowards," chimed in a painted
woman, dressed in a poor and tawdry dress. She was
a street-walker, nicknamed by her admirers the She-wolf.
"Do you know," she went on wrathfully,
"what the holy martyrs Macedonius, Theodulus, and
Tertian replied to their executioners?"
</p><p>
"No, She-wolf, tell us."
</p><p>
"Well, I've heard. At Myrrha, in Phrygia, three
young men, Macedonius, Theodulus, and Tertian, had
burst into a Greek temple by night, and smashed the
idols to the glory of God. The proconsul Amachius
had them seized, stretched them on dripping-pans, and
ordered fires to be lighted under them. The three
martyrs said: 'If you want to taste cooked flesh,
Amachius, turn us over on the other side, that we may
not be served up to you half-cooked!' and all three
laughed and spat in the face of the proconsul. And
everybody saw an angel come down out of heaven
with three crowns! <i>You</i> wouldn't have spoken so!
You're too fearful for your skins.... It's heart-breaking,
just to look at you!"
</p><p>
The She-wolf turned away in disgust.
</p><p>
Cries rose from the street.
</p><p>
"Perhaps they're breaking up idols?" suggested
the shoemaker pleasantly.
</p><p>
"Forward, citizens! Follow me!" shouted Strombix,
waving his arms; but he slipped on the table, and
would have fallen had not Aragaris caught him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
</p><p>
Everybody rushed to the door. An enormous crowd
was advancing down the principal street and, filling the
narrow cross-roads, brought up before the baths.
</p><p>
"Old Pamva! Old Pamva!" the idlers were shouting.
"He's come from the desert to help the people;
to pull down the great, and to save the humble and
poor!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XI</h2>

<p>The old man had a coarse face, with high cheek-bones,
bearded to the eyes. A patched piece of
sacking served him as inner robe, and a hooded sheep's
skin as cloak or chlamys. For twenty years, Pamva
had never washed himself, considering cleanliness sinful,
and believing that a special fiend presided over
any acts of care for the body. He dwelt in a fearful
desert, the Berean, round Chalybon, to the east of
Antioch, where serpents and scorpions swarmed at the
bottom of the arid water-courses. His lodging was the
deep sandy hollow of a dried-up well, called <i>coubba</i> in
Syriac, where he used to feed himself on five stalks a
day of a sweet and flowery kind of reed. He had
nearly died of starvation. His disciples descended to
feed him by means of ropes. Then, during seven
years, he lived on a half-measure of boiled lentils.
His sight grew feeble; his skin became leprous and
scurvy; he therefore added a little oil to his lentils,
and accused himself of worship of the belly.
</p><p>
Pamva, learning from his disciples that the Emperor
Julian, the fierce Anti-Christ, was persecuting the
Christians, left his retreat and came to Antioch to
strengthen weak-kneed believers&mdash;
</p><p>
"Listen! listen!... he's going to speak."
</p><p>
Pamva climbed the staircase of the baths and halted
on a broad landing. His eyes glittered with condensed
ire. He stretched out his arms, pointing out
to the people palaces, pagan temples, baths, shops,
courts of justice, all the monuments of Antioch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
</p><p>
"Not a stone of these shall remain! All shall
crumble and disappear. The holy fire shall burn up
the universe. The heavens, like a smouldering palace,
shall sink away! That shall be the terrible judgment
of Christ, the unimaginable spectacle. Whither shall
I turn mine eyes, and what shall I wonder at, if it be
not the groaning of kings, cast down into darkness?
If it be not the terror of Aphrodite, the goddess of love,
shivering in her nakedness before the Crucified? If
it be not the flight of Jupiter, and all the Olympians,
before the thunders of the Most High?... Triumph,
ye martyrs, and rejoice, ye persecuted! See your
judges, the Roman proconsuls, seized by more terrible
flames than yours. Nor shall the syllogisms of Aristotle,
nor the demonstrations of Plato save you, philosophers,
hurled into hell! And, on that stage, their
actors shall roar, as the heroes of Sophocles and
Æschylus never roared before! And their rope-dancers,
trust, me, shall dance a quicker step in that
fire! And we, the poor and ignorant, shall rejoice and
say to the strong, wise, and the haughty: Behold the
Crucified, the son of the carpenter and the work-woman,
the King of Judæa, crowned in purple and
thorns! Behold the Sabbath-breaker, the Samaritan
woman possessed of the devil! See Him, whom you
led bound with cords into your prætorium, Him whose
thirst you quenched with vinegar and hyssop! And
we shall hear in answer weepings and gnashings of
teeth. We shall laugh, our hearts overflowing with
joy! Come, come, come, Lord Jesus!"
</p><p>
Gluturius, the cleanser of sewers, fell on his knees,
and blinking his inflamed eyelids as if he saw Christ
descending, stretched out his arms. The metal-founder
clenched his fists, collected his forces like a bull ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
to charge. And the livid-faced weaver, trembling in
all his limbs, with an amazed smile was murmuring,
"Lord, let me, too, suffer!"
</p><p>
The animal faces of beggars and sharpers expressed
the mischievous triumph of the weak over the strong;
of slaves over their masters. The She-wolf grinned in
silence, and an insatiable thirst for vengeance twinkled
in her drunken eyes.
</p><p>
Suddenly, the jingle of weapons and the heavy step
of horses. The Roman legionaries of the night-watch
wheeled round the corner of the road. At their head
strode the prefect, Sallustius Secundus, a man with
aquiline nose, open face, and a look of calmness and
kindly intelligence. He wore the senatorial laticlave,
and gave an impression of self-confidence and patrician
nobleness. Above the distant Pantheon, erected by
Antiochus Seleucus, slowly arose the great reddish
moon, and its rays were glittering on shields and
breastplates&mdash;
</p><p>
"Disperse, citizens!" said Sallustius, addressing the
crowd. "By order of Augustus crowds are forbidden
in the streets of Antioch by night."
</p><p>
The populace groaned and murmured. Street-boys
whistled, and one audacious voice sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Good-bye to the white cocks!</p>
<p class="i2">Good-bye to the white ox!</p>
<p class="i2">For Julian knocks them on the head</p>
<p class="i2">To feed his devils and the dead!"</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a threatening clash of arms. The legionaries
unsheathed their swords and prepared to charge.
Old Pamva struck the marble flags with his staff, and
shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Hail, gallant army of Satan! Hail, wise Roman
dignitary! You'll probably remember the time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
you burned us, when you taught us philosophy, and we
prayed God to save your lost souls! Welcome to
you!"
</p><p>
The legionaries gripped their swords, but the prefect
with a gesture stopped them. He saw that the crowd
was in his power.
</p><p>
"What are you threatening us with, blockhead?"
asked Pamva, addressing himself to Sallustius. "What
can you do? All we want for vengeance is a black
night and two or three torches. You fear the Alemanni
and the Persians. We are more terrible than
they. We are everywhere in the midst of you, inviolable,
innumerable! We have no boundaries, no father-land;
we recognise but one republic, the universal
republic! Born but yesterday, already we are filling
the world, filling your cities, your fortresses, your
islands, city councils, camps, palaces, senates, forums!
We leave you your temples!... And but for our
humility, our fraternity, choosing rather to die than
to slay, we should have blotted you out....
</p><p>
"We want neither sword nor fire! So many are
we, that if we withdrew, you would perish. Your cities
would become solitudes, you would be frightened at
your own loneliness, at the silence of the universe!
All life would stop, at that death-touch! Remember
the Roman Empire exists only on sufferance, sustained
by the mercy of us Christians!"
</p><p>
All eyes being fixed on Pamva no one perceived a
man clothed in the old chlamys of a wandering philosopher,
with a lean yellow face, curling hair, and long
black beard, quickly coming through the lines of
legionaries, who respectfully made way for him. He
was followed by a few companions, and, leaning towards
Sallustius, whispered&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
</p><p>
"What are you waiting for?"
</p><p>
"They will perhaps disperse of themselves," responded
Sallustius. "The Galileans have already too
many martyrs for us to make any more of them. They
fly towards death as bees to honey!"
</p><p>
But the man in the philosopher's robe advanced
and cried out with a distinct voice, like a captain
accustomed to command&mdash;
</p><p>
"Scatter the crowd. Seize the ringleaders!"
</p><p>
Everybody wheeled round, and in alarm shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Augustus! Augustus Julian!"
</p><p>
The soldiers charged with drawn swords. The old
rag-picker was knocked down, struggling and shrieking
under the feet of the legionaries. Many fled, and
Strombix was the first to take advantage of the general
confusion. Stones hurtled through the air. The
metal-founder, defending old Pamva, hurled a large
jagged flint at a legionary. It struck the She-wolf,
who fell with a slight cry, covered with blood, and
convinced that she was dying a martyr.
</p><p>
A legionary seized Gluturius; but the sewer-cleaner
gave himself up so readily (the prospect of becoming
an admired martyr appearing so enviable in comparison
with his present occupation), and his rags gave off such
a stink, that the disgusted soldier immediately released
his prisoner.
</p><p>
In the midst of the crowd there was a market-gardener
who had chanced by, leading an ass laden
with cabbages. Mouth agape, he had listened to old
Pamva from beginning to end. Noticing the danger,
he now tried to flee, but his ass starkly refused. In
vain was the beast belaboured. Buttressed against his
forefeet, with ears lowered and tail lifted, it uttered a
deafening series of brays, drowning in its triumphant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
stupidity the death-rattle of the dying, the oaths of the
soldiery, and the prayers of Galileans.
</p><p>
Oribazius, who was among the companions of Julian,
came up to the Emperor&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian, what are you doing? Is it worthy of your
wisdom?..."
</p><p>
The Emperor cast on him a stern look, and Oribazius
was silent, not daring to finish his protest.
</p><p>
In the last few months Julian had not only changed
but grown old. His worn face had the sad and terrible
expression of those gnawed by some long and incurable
malady, or absorbed in some fixed idea akin to madness.
His powerful hands were unconsciously tearing
to pieces a roll of papyrus. At last he said in a deep
voice, with eyes kept steadily on Oribazius&mdash;
</p><p>
"Away! I know what I am doing.... With
these scoundrels who have no faith in the gods, one
cannot deal as with human beings. They must be destroyed
like wild beasts. And for the matter of that,
what harm would be done if a dozen Galileans were
slain by the hand of the Hellenists?"
</p><p>
Oribazius mused&mdash;
</p><p>
"How like he is now, in his fury, to his cousin
Constantius!"
</p><p>
Julian spoke to the crowd, and his voice appeared to
himself even strange and terrible&mdash;
</p><p>
"By the grace of the gods I am still Emperor!
Galileans, obey! You may mock at my beard and
clothes, but not at the Roman law.... Remember,
I am punishing you for rebellion and not for religion.
Chain that rascal!"
</p><p>
With a shaking hand he pointed to Pamva, who
was promptly seized by two fair-haired Batavians.
</p><p>
"Thou liest, atheist!" shouted Pamva triumphantly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
"You are punishing us for our faith. Why do you
not pardon me, as you did Maris the blind Chalcedonian?
Where is now your philosophy? Have the
times changed? Have you overshot your mark?
Brothers, fear not the Roman Cæsar, but the Almighty
God!"
</p><p>
The crowd gave up all idea of flight. All were infected
by the fever of martyrdom. The Batavians and
the Celts were startled by the sight of a mob rushing
joyfully on death. Even children threw themseves on
the swords and lances. Julian wished to stop the massacre.
He was too late; the bees were making for the
honey. He could only exclaim, in scorn and despair&mdash;
</p><p>
"Unhappy people! If life weighs on you, is it so
difficult for you to shorten it for yourselves?"
</p><p>
And Pamva in bonds, lifted by sinewy arms, retorted
with joy&mdash;
</p><p>
"Exterminate us, Roman, we shall multiply the
more! The dungeon is our liberty; weakness, our
strength: death, our victory!"

<h2 class="p2">XII</h2>

<p>
At about five miles from Antioch, up the course of
the river Orontes, stood the celebrated wood of
Daphne, consecrated to Apollo. Therein a temple had
been built, where every year the praises of the Sun-god
were celebrated.
</p><p>
Julian, without saying anything of his intention
quitted Antioch at the break of day. He wished to
ascertain for himself whether the inhabitants remembered
the ancient sacred feast. All along the road he
mused of the solemnity, hoping to see lads and virgins
going up the steps of the temple, clad in white as a
symbol of purity and youth, the crowd of the faithful,
the choirs, and the smoke of incense.
</p><p>
The road was difficult; from the rocky Berean hills
a gusty burning wind came down. The atmosphere
was laden with the bitter smell of burnt wood, and
thick with a bluish fog which spread itself over the
deep gorge of Mount Kazia. Harassing dust filled
eyes and throat, and crackled between the teeth of the
traveller. The very sun through the smoky vapour
seemed red and sickly. But hardly had the Emperor
penetrated into the wood of Daphne than fragrant coolness
surrounded him. It was difficult to believe that
such a corner of Paradise could be found at a few paces
from the scorching road. The wood was twenty-four
stadia in circumference, and perpetual twilight reigned
in its almost impenetrable alleys of gigantic laurels,
planted centuries before. The Emperor was surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
at the solitariness of the wood&mdash;no worshippers, no
victims, no incense, nor any preparation for the solemn
feast-day. Thinking that the people must be assembled
near the temple, he pushed on farther. At every step
the wood became more lonely. It was as untroubled
by any sound as an abandoned cemetery. Birds were
few, the shadow of the laurel-grove being too thick,
and no song of theirs was heard. A grasshopper
began his shrill cry in the grass, and quickly ceased,
as if startled at his own voice. Insects alone were
humming faintly in a slender ray of sunlight, but
ventured not to quit its beam for the neighbouring
gloom. Sometimes Julian pushed his path along wider
alleys, bordered with titanic walls of weird cypress,
casting shade dark as a moonless night. Here and
there subterranean waters made the moss spongy.
Streams ran everywhere, chill as melted snow, but
silently, with no tinkling ripples, as if muted by the
melancholy of that enchanted wood. In one nook, a
rift in the rock, clear drops were falling slowly, glittering,
one by one. But moss stifled the sound of their
fall, and they sank away like the tears of an unspoken
love.
</p><p>
There were broad glens of wild narcissus, many lilies,
and even butterflies. But these were dark-winged and
not gay-coloured, for the sun-rays filtered through the
thick laurel became almost lunar-pale, and pensive as
if fallen through the smoke of a funeral torch. It was
as though Ph&oelig;bus had grown faint and inconsolable
after the final loss of Daphne. And she, remaining,
overcast and shadowy under the most burning kisses
of the god, here kept impenetrable coolness and bloom
under her branches for ever.
</p><p>
Everywhere in that wood reigned the abandonment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
the tender melancholy of the god who loved in
vain.
</p><p>
Already in sight, and dazzling through the cypresses,
shone the columns and pediments of the temple raised
in the time of Seleucus Nicator. But not a worshipper
yet had Julian encountered. At last he saw a child of
twelve years old, on a path overgrown with wild
hyacinth. His dark eyes shone strangely brilliant in
his finely cut pale face. Golden hair fell in curls on
his slender neck, and his blue-veined temples were
transparent as the petals of a flower grown in the shade.
</p><p>
"Do you know, child, where are the sacrificers and
the people?" Julian asked.
</p><p>
The child made no answer, as if he had not understood
the question.
</p><p>
"Listen, little one, can you not lead me to the priest
of Apollo?"
</p><p>
He shook his head, smiling.
</p><p>
"Why will you not answer me?"
</p><p>
Then the boy put a finger to his lips and then to both
his ears, and shook his head gravely this time.
</p><p>
Julian thought&mdash;
</p><p>
"This must be a deaf-mute."
</p><p>
The child looked shyly askance at the Emperor, who
grew almost fearful in the silent twilight of the deserted
wood in the company of the elf, who stared at
him fixedly and haughtily as a little god.
</p><p>
Suddenly, he pointed out to Julian an old man,
clothed in a patched and tattered tunic; Julian immediately
recognised a temple priest. The weak and
broken old man stumbled along in drunken fashion,
laughing and mumbling to himself as he went. He
was red-nosed and completely bald except for a fringe
of downy grey hair. His watery and short-sighted eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
had an expression of childlike benevolence. He was
carrying a large basket.
</p><p>
"The priest of Apollo?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"I am he. I am called Gorgius. What do you
want, good man?"
</p><p>
"Can you direct me to the high-priest of this temple
and the people worshipping here?"
</p><p>
Gorgius made no answer at first, but put his panier
on the ground. Then he rubbed his bald pate and,
standing with arms akimbo, held his head on one side
winking mischievously with his left eye.
</p><p>
"And why am <i>I</i> not the high-priest of Apollo?" he
asked, "and what worshippers do you mean, my son?...
May the Olympians protect you."
</p><p>
He smelt strongly of wine. Julian thought his
behaviour indecent and prepared to administer a
rebuke&mdash;
</p><p>
"You seem to be drunk, old man."
</p><p>
Gorgius, in no wise perturbed, continued to rub the
back of his neck.
</p><p>
"Drunk? I don't think so. But I may have tossed
off five cups or so, for the sake of the celebrations; and
as to that, I drink more through sorrow than merriment.
Yes, my son, may the Olympians have you in
their keeping!... Who are you? By your dress
perhaps a wandering philosopher, or a professor from
the schools of Antioch?"
</p><p>
The Emperor smiled and nodded his head in acquiescence.
He wished to make the priest talk freely.
</p><p>
"You have hit it. I am a teacher."
</p><p>
"Christian?"
</p><p>
"No, Hellenist."
</p><p>
"Ah, that's good. There are many others of your
way of thinking who hang about this neighbourhood."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
</p><p>
"You have not yet answered me as to where the
people are: whether many victims have been sent from
Antioch; whether the choirs are ready."
</p><p>
"Victims? Small thanks for victims," said the old
man, laughing and stumbling so violently that he
nearly tumbled down. "Many's the long year, my
brother, since we saw that kind of thing!... Since
the time of Constantine...." Gorgius snapped his
fingers despairingly and whistled. "It is all over&mdash;done
for!... Phut!... Men have forgotten the
gods. Not only have we no victims, but we don't
even get a handful of wheat to cook a cake; not a
grain of incense, not a drop of oil for the lamps....
There's nothing for it but to go to bed and die!...
Yes, my son! may the Olympians protect you!...
The monks have taken everything!... and they
fight each other; they're rolling in fat.... Our tale
is told.... Ah! bad times these. And you say
'Don't drink!' But it's hard not to drink when one
suffers. If I didn't drink a bit I should have hanged
myself long ago."
</p><p>
"And no one has come from Antioch for this great
feast day?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"None but you, my son. I am the priest, you are the
people! We will together offer the victim to the god."
</p><p>
"You have just told me that you received no
victims!"
</p><p>
Gorgius rubbed the back of his neck, grinning&mdash;
</p><p>
"We received none from others, but there is my
own offering. Weve eaten little for three days,
Hepherion and I, to save the necessary money. Look!"
</p><p>
He raised the lid of the basket. A tethered goose
slid out its head, cackling and trying to escape.
</p><p>
"Ha, ha, ha! is not that a victim?" asked the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
man proudly. "Although it isn't a fat young goose
it is nevertheless a sacred bird! Apollo ought to be
glad of it just now. The gods consider geese a delicacy."
</p><p>
"Have you long dwelt in this temple?" questioned
Julian.
</p><p>
"For forty years and perhaps longer...."
</p><p>
"Is this your son?" asked Julian, pointing to
Hepherion, who was staring at him as if he were trying
to follow the conversation.
</p><p>
"No. I have neither relatives nor friends. Hepherion
helps me at the hours for sacrifice."
</p><p>
"Who are his father and mother?"
</p><p>
"I do not know the father and I strongly suspect
that no one knows who he is. But his mother was the
great sibyl Diotima, who long lived in this temple.
She would never speak nor raise her veil before men.
She was chaste as a vestal. When she brought this
child into the world we were all astonished, and at a
loss what to think ... but a learned centenarian, a
magian told us...."
</p><p>
Gorgius, with a mysterious air, put his hand before
his mouth and muttered in Julian's ear as if he feared
the child could catch his words&mdash;
</p><p>
"The hierophant told us that he was no son of man,
but a god come down by night to the sibyl while she
was asleep within the temple! See how beautiful he
is!"
</p><p>
"A deaf-mute son of a god?" murmured the Emperor,
surprised.
</p><p>
"In times like ours if the son of the god and of the
sibyl were not a deaf-mute he would die of grief," answered
Gorgius. "See how thin and pale he is
already!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
</p><p>
"Who knows," said Julian, with a sad smile, "but
that you are right, old man. In our days it is well for
a prophet to be a deaf-mute."
</p><p>
Suddenly the child approached Julian and looking
at him fixedly, seized his hand and kissed it. A thrill
ran through Julian.
</p><p>
"My son," said the old man, gravely, "may the
Olympians shield you; you must be a good man.
That child never kisses the evil nor the impious, and
he flees from the monks as from the plague. I think
he sees and understands more than either of us but can
utter nothing. I've often surprised him sitting before
the statue of Apollo for hours, gazing at him with joy
as if he were talking with the god."
</p><p>
The face of Hepherion grew dark and he went away.
</p><p>
Gorgius smote his head and said&mdash;
</p><p>
"I am wasting time in gossip. The sun is up; the
sacrifice must be performed. Come!"
</p><p>
"Wait," said the Emperor. "I wished to ask you
something more. Have you ever heard that the Emperor
Julian desired to restore to honour the worship
of the old gods?"
</p><p>
"Yes, but ... what can <i>he</i> do, poor man? He
will not succeed. I tell you&mdash;all's over!"
</p><p>
"Have you faith in the gods?" asked Julian.
"Can the Olympians quit us so for ever?"
</p><p>
The old man sighed, and hanging his head&mdash;
</p><p>
"My son, you're young; although there are white
hairs shining in your dark locks, and furrows on your
brow already. But in the days when my hair was
black and young girls used to look at me with favour,
I remember sailing in a ship, near Thessalonica, and
seeing Mount Olympus. Its base and its girdle melted
into blue, and its snowy summit seemed hanging in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
the air, dominating sky and sea, golden and inaccessible.
I mused 'Behold the dwelling of the gods!'
and I was full of emotion. But on this same ship there
was a scoffing old man who called himself an Epicurean.
He pointed out Mount Olympus, and said to me: 'My
friend, travellers have long ago climbed Olympus, and
they saw that it was an ordinary mountain, like other
mountains, on which there was nothing but snow, ice
and stones!' And those words sank so deep into my
heart that I shall remember them all my life."
</p><p>
The Emperor smiled&mdash;
</p><p>
"Old man, your faith is childish. Suppose there
were no Olympus&mdash;why should not the gods exist
above, in the kingdom of the eternal Ideas, in the
realm of the soul's light?"
</p><p>
Gorgius hung his head lower yet&mdash;
</p><p>
"Yes, yes, yes!... but ... nevertheless all is
over. Olympus is deserted."
</p><p>
Julian gazed at him, surprised.
</p><p>
"You see," continued Gorgius, "the earth breeds
nowadays only hard men or weak men. The gods can
only laugh at them, or grow wrath with them. They
are not worth destroying. They will perish of themselves
by sickness, debauchery, or decline. The gods
are grown weary and they have departed!"
</p><p>
"And do you think, Gorgius, that the human race
must disappear?"
</p><p>
The priest shook his bald head&mdash;
</p><p>
"Ah, ah, ah! The earth is in pain. The rivers
flow more slowly; the flowers in spring have not their
old fragrance. An ancient fisherman lately told me
that one can see Etna no longer as we used to do. The
air has become thicker and darker, the sun is waxing
weak; the end of the world is near...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
</p><p>
"Tell me, Gorgius, can you remember better
times?"
</p><p>
The old man brightened up, and his eyes shone.
</p><p>
"When I first came here in the first years of the
reign of Constantine," he said joyfully, "grand festivals
were celebrated every year in honour of Apollo.
What numbers of lads and virgins used to come to this
holy wood! How the moon used to shine! How exquisite
the smell of the cypresses! How the nightingales
used to sing! And when their chant ceased,
the air would tremble with nocturnal kisses and sighings
of love, as with the beatings of invisible wings."
</p><p>
Gorgius was silent and plunged in thought.
</p><p>
At that moment the sound of church-singing came
from behind the trees.
</p><p>
"What is that?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"The monks," answered the priest. "Monks
praying over a dead Galilean."
</p><p>
"What, a Galilean in the wood sacred to Apollo?'"
</p><p>
"Yes; they call him the martyr Babylas. Ten years
ago the brother of the Emperor Julian, Cæsar Gallus,
transferred the bones of this Babylas from Antioch into
this wood, and had a superb sarcophagus made for him.
From that day the oracle ceased. The temple was sullied
and the god departed."
</p><p>
"What sacrilege!" exclaimed the Emperor indignantly.
</p><p>
"That year the virgin sibyl Diotima gave birth to a
deaf-mute child, a bad omen. Only one sacred spring
was left us and did not dry up, the spring called Tears
of the Sun ... over there, where the child is now
sitting...."
</p><p>
Julian turned round. The boy was sitting in front
of the mossy rock, motionless, and in his open palm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
receiving the falling drops. Julian almost imagined he
saw two transparent wings trembling behind the
divinely beautiful child. So sad, so pale, so enchanting
his look, that the Emperor mused&mdash;
</p><p>
"He must be Eros, the little god of love, dying in
our century of Galilean moroseness, and in his hand
receiving the last drops, the last tears of love, tears of
the god over Daphne, over the vanished beauty of
Daphne!"
</p><p>
The deaf-mute remained motionless, and a great
black velvety butterfly alighted on his head. He
neither saw it, nor stirred. Like a malign shadow the
butterfly opened and shut its wings, while the Tears
of the Sun dropped, one by one, into the hand of
Hepherion. Louder and louder in the distance rose
funereal psalms.
</p><p>
Suddenly from behind the cypresses came the sound
of voices disputing&mdash;
</p><p>
"Augustus is there."
</p><p>
"Why should he go alone to Daphne?"
</p><p>
"Why not? to-day is the great festival of Apollo.
See, there he is ... Julian, we have sought you
since the morning!"
</p><p>
They were Greek sophists, men of science and rhetoricians,
habitual companions of the Emperor, and
with them the Neo-Platonist Priscus of Epirus, the
bilious sceptic Julius Mauricus, the wise Sallustius
Secundus, and the celebrated orator Libanius.
</p><p>
Julian vouchsafed them not the least attention.
</p><p>
"What's the matter?" murmured Julius to
Priscus.
</p><p>
"He must be displeased that there has been no preparation
for the feast! We have not sent a single
offering...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian addressed the former Christian rhetorician,
now the high-priest of Astarte, Hekobolis&mdash;
</p><p>
"Go into the neighbouring chapel, and inform the
Galileans praying there of my will. Let them come
here."
</p><p>
Hekobolis went.
</p><p>
Gorgius, still holding his basket, stood petrified,
with eyes and mouth wide open. He rubbed his bald
head. Had he not drunk too much? It must all be
a dream! But when he remembered all he had said
about Julian and the god to the pretended professor, a
cold sweat broke out on his forehead, his legs trembled,
and he fell on his knees&mdash;
</p><p>
"Pardon, Cæsar! Forget my words!"
</p><p>
One of the philosophers wished to thrust away the
old man; but Julian stopped him&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do not insult the sacrificial priest. Rise, Gorgius,
there is my hand; fear nothing. So long as I live,
none shall do harm to you or to your little lad. You
and I both came for the festival, both love the old
gods. We will be friends and rejoice together at this
feast of the Sun!"
</p><p>
The psalms had meantime ceased. Frightened
monks appeared coming up the alley of cypresses,
deacons and superiors still in the sacerdotal dress and
led by Hekobolis. The arch-priest, a fat man with a
shining red face, walked swaying from side to side,
much out of breath and wiping his brow. He saluted
Augustus profoundly, reaching one finger to the
ground, and said in a pleasant bass voice&mdash;
</p><p>
"May the humane Augustus pardon his unworthy
servants!"
</p><p>
He bowed lower yet, and two novices skilfully assisted
him to rise again. One of them had forgotten to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
put away the censer, from which the incense was escaping
in thin fillets of smoke.
</p><p>
At the sight of the monks Hepherion fled. Julian
said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Galileans, I order you to rid the sacred wood of
Apollo of the relics of your co-religionist. We do not
desire to use force against you, but if our will is not
carried out, I must myself see that Helios is delivered
from such sacrilege. I shall send here my soldiers,
who will disinter the bones, burn them, and scatter the
ashes to the winds."
</p><p>
The arch-priest coughed, and finally said in a humble
tone&mdash;
</p><p>
"Most merciful Cæsar, that is hard on us, for these
relics have long rested here, in a place blessed by the
will of Cæsar Gallus. But as it is a matter beyond our
jurisdiction, we are forced to refer it to the bishop."
</p><p>
A murmur ran through the crowd; an urchin hidden
in a laurel bush shouted&mdash;

</p><blockquote><p>
"The butcher comes<br />
With a big, big knife!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he received such a buffet that he fled, howling.
</p><p>
The arch-priest, feeling that decency obliged him to
defend the relics, coughed again and began&mdash;
</p><p>
"If it pleases your High Wisdom to give this order
on account of the idol..." he quickly corrected
himself.
</p><p>
"Of the Hellenic god, Helios...."
</p><p>
The Emperor's eyes sparkled with rage.
</p><p>
"The 'idol,'" he interrupted, "'idol' is your
word. For what imbeciles do you take us, if you
think that we worship the matter that represents our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
gods, metal, stone, or wood. All your preachers preach
this, but it is a lie. We worship not these things, but
the soul, the living soul of beauty in these models of
the purest human beauty. It is not we, the idolaters,
but you&mdash;you, who devour each other like wild beasts
for the sake of an iota; you, who kiss the rotten bones
of criminals punished for breaking the Roman laws;
you, who call the fratricide Constantius an 'Eternal
Holiness!' To deify the splendid sculptures of Phidias,
which breathe Olympian beauty and goodness, is that
less reasonable than to bow before two crossed beams of
wood, a shameful instrument of torture? Must one
blush for you, pity you, or hate you? It is the pitch
of mad degradation for our country, to see sons of the
Hellenes, who read Plato and Homer, rushing to an
outcast tribe, a tribe almost blotted out by Vespasian
and Titus, in order to deify a dead man!... And
you still dare to accuse us of idolatry!"
</p><p>
The arch-priest imperturbably stroked his long
beard, and looking at Julian askance, wiped the perspiration
from his glistening forehead.
</p><p>
Then the Emperor said to Priscus the philosopher&mdash;
</p><p>
"My friend, accomplish the Delian mysteries with
which you are familiar. We must purify the Temple
of Apollo. He will return to his dwelling, and once
we have taken away the stone which seals the spring,
the oracle will speak again."
</p><p>
The arch-priest terminated the interview with a deep
bow and the same obsequious manner, in which an invincible
tenacity could be felt&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let your will be done, Cæsar. We are the children,
you are the father; but there is no power above
the power of God."
</p><p>
"Oh, you hypocrites, I know your obedience and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
your humility! Your humility is the serpent's fang!
Why not struggle against me at least like men?"
</p><p>
Julian turned round to depart, when a little old
man and woman issued from the crowd and prostrated
themselves at his feet. They were poorly but cleanly
dressed, and bore a surprising resemblance to each
other, reminding him of Philemon and Baucis.
</p><p>
"Protect us, just Cæsar," whispered the old man.
"We have a little house near Antioch at the foot of
the Stavrinus. We've lived there twenty years, and
now the town-senators, the decurions, are come...."
The old man clasped his hands despairingly, and the
old woman, imitating him, did the same.
</p><p>
"The decurions come and say, 'This house does not
belong to you!'&mdash;'What&mdash;the Lord be with you&mdash;we've
been here twenty years!'&mdash;'Yes; but you had
no right. The land belongs to the temple of the god
Æsculapius, and your house is built with the temple-stones.
It must return to Æsculapius.' What does
this mean?... Have mercy, all-powerful Augustus!"
</p><p>
The two old people, with their clear and childlike
faces, were kneeling before him, and weeping, kissed
his feet.
</p><p>
Julian perceived an amber cross on the woman's
neck.
</p><p>
"Are you Christians?" he asked, his brow growing
sombre.
</p><p>
"Yes."
</p><p>
"I should like to grant your prayer ... but how
is it to be done? The land belongs to the god....
Nevertheless, your property shall be paid for."
</p><p>
"No, no," cried out the old people, "we're
rooted there by all our habits. We don't ask for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
money. But there everything is ours; we know every
blade of grass...."
</p><p>
"There everything is ours," repeated the old woman
like an echo. "The vine, the chickens, the cow, the
olives, the pigs&mdash;everything is ours. And there's the
step too, on which in the evening we have warmed our
old bones in the sun, side by side, for these twenty
years."
</p><p>
The Emperor, without listening, turned toward the
startled crowd&mdash;
</p><p>
"Latterly the Galileans have overwhelmed me with
demands for the return of lands belonging to the
churches, and the Valentinians accuse the Arians of
having robbed them of their properties. To cut short
dispute I have given half of those lands to the Gallic
warriors and the other half to the Imperial Treasury;
and I am decided to act similarly in future. By what
right, you ask? But is it not more easy for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven? You glorify poverty,
Galileans? Why murmur against me? In taking
property which you yourselves have taken from your
brother-heretics, or from Olympian temples, I am only
restoring you to wholesome poverty and the narrow
way into the heavenly kingdom."
</p><p>
An evil smile curled his lips.
</p><p>
"We're injured unjustly," groaned the two old
people.
</p><p>
"Well, suffer the injustice!" answered Julian.
"You should rejoice in persecution. What are these
sufferings to eternal bliss?"
</p><p>
The old man, unprepared for this deduction, stammered
in dismay, as a forlorn hope&mdash;
</p><p>
"We are your faithful slaves, Augustus. My son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
serves on the military staff, in a distant fortress of the
Roman frontier, and his superior officers think well of
him...."
</p><p>
"Is he also a Christian?" interrupted Julian.
</p><p>
"Yes," sighed the old man, and was immediately
dismayed at the avowal.
</p><p>
"You have done well to warn me. As proved enemies
of the Roman Augustus, Christians must not
henceforth occupy high Imperial office, above all in the
army. I am more of your Master's opinion than you
are yourselves. How should disciples of Jesus do justice
according to the Roman law, when He has said,
'<i>Judge not, and ye shall not be judged</i>'? How should
Christians rightly defend the Empire by the sword,
when they were taught by Him '<i>He who shall take up
the sword shall perish by the sword</i>'; and again, '<i>Resist
not evil</i>'? Therefore, for the safety of your souls, we
shall withdraw Christians from the law and from the
army of Rome; that helpless, and disarmed, and free
from frivolous earthliness, they may reach the kingdom
of heaven!"
</p><p>
Smiling inwardly, and so robbing his hatred of still
greater bitterness, the Emperor strode rapidly toward
the Temple of Apollo.
</p><p>
The old people stretched their arms after him,
sobbing&mdash;
</p><p>
"Cæsar, we did it unwittingly! Take our house,
our land, all that we have, but have pity on our
son!"
</p><p>
The philosophers wished to enter the temple, but the
Emperor waved them back&mdash;
</p><p>
"I came to the festival alone. I alone will offer the
sacrifice!"
</p><p>
"Let us go in," he added, addressing Gorgius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
</p><p>
"Close the doors, and let none of the unconsecrated
enter...."
</p><p>
And the doors were shut in the faces of his philosopher
friends.
</p><p>
"'Unconsecrated?' How do you like that?"
asked Garguillus moodily.
</p><p>
Libanius stood sulking in silence.
</p><p>
Mauricus, with a mysterious air, dragged his friends
into a corner of the portico, and touching his forehead
with a finger murmured&mdash;
</p><p>
"Do you understand?"
</p><p>
All were dumbfounded.
</p><p>
"Is it possible?"
</p><p>
Mauricus began to reckon&mdash;
</p><p>
"First, pallor, feverish appearance, disordered hair,
irregular step, incoherent speeches; second, excessive
harshness and nervousness; third, this stupid war
against the Persians!... By Pallas, it clearly means
madness!"
</p><p>
The friends drew closer, and began to tell each other
all sorts of anecdotes. Sallustius, who held aloof, contemplated
the group with a bitter smile.
</p><p>
Within the temple Julian found Hepherion, who
brightened on seeing him, and several times during
the rite gazed into the Emperor's face, as if the two
had some secret in common. Shining in the sunlight,
the colossal statue of Apollo stood in the midst of the
temple, its body ivory and its garments golden, like
those of the Zeus by Phidias at Olympia. The god,
stooping slightly, was pouring the nectar of his cup to
the Earth-Mother, praying her to restore him Daphne.
</p><p>
A slight cloud passed above the temple. Shadows
ran over the time-yellowed ivory. It seemed to Julian
that the god benignly stooped still lower, to receive the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
offering of the last adorers&mdash;the weak priest, the apostate
Emperor, and the deaf-mute son of the sibyl.
</p><p>
"This is my reward," thought Julian. "I wish
for no other glory, nor guerdon, O Apollo! I thank
thee for the curses of the crowd; and for thy grace,
in making me live and die alone, like thyself! There,
where the populace prays, there is no god! Thou art
here, in this sanctuary profaned. O god, scorned by
mankind, now art thou far more beautiful than of old
when they adored thee! On the day marked for me
by the Fates, let me be joined again to thee, O Radiant
One! Let me die in thee, Sun, as the fire of the last
offering dies in thy rays!"
</p><p>
So prayed the Emperor, tears streaming down his
cheeks, and one by one the drops of the victim's blood
fell like tears on the half-consumed embers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIII</h2>

<p>A profound obscurity enveloped the wood of
Daphne on all sides. A hot wind was hunting
the clouds along. For days not a drop of rain had
fallen on the cracked and arid earth. The laurels were
shaking their black branches to heaven. The low roar
of the cypresses in their titanic alleys was like the murmur
of a crowd of angry old men.
</p><p>
Two persons were gliding cautiously through the
shadow towards the Temple of Apollo. The smaller,
who had green eyes like a cat, saw clearly through
the night, and was leading the more stalwart by the
hand.
</p><p>
"Oh! oh! you scoundrel! we shall break our necks
in some ditch!"
</p><p>
"There is no ditch here! What are you afraid of?
Since you adopted the new religion you've become a
regular old woman!"
</p><p>
"An old woman!... When I used to hunt the
bear my heart had never a throb the quicker! But
here ... this isn't a job like that!... We shall
swing for it, side by side, on the same gallows, my
boy."
</p><p>
"Nonsense! Be quiet, you great fool!"
</p><p>
The small man again began dragging along the
bigger, who carried an enormous truss of hay and a
pickaxe.
</p><p>
They arrived at a postern door of the temple.
</p><p>
"Here, use the pick!" muttered the little man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
groping with his hands for cracks in the stone. "And
you can cut the cross-timbers with the axe...."
</p><p>
Suddenly there came a cry, like the complaint of a
sick child. The tall man trembled in all his limbs&mdash;
</p><p>
"What is it?"
</p><p>
"The Demon!" exclaimed the little one, his eyes
staring with affright, clutching at the clothes of his
companion&mdash;
</p><p>
"You won't desert me, old fellow?"
</p><p>
"It's an owl!... Well, he can plume himself on
having scared us!"
</p><p>
The enormous night-bird, startled from his nest,
flew away with a sobbing cry.
</p><p>
"Let's give it up," said the tall man. "That will
never kindle."
</p><p>
"Why not? The wood's rotten, dry as tinder in
the sun, and all worm-eaten.... A single spark will
do. Come, work along!"
</p><p>
And the little man shoved the taller.
</p><p>
"Now, push the straw into the hole!... more,
more, for the glory of the Father, of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost!"
</p><p>
"Why are you fidgeting about like an eel?" said
the tall man, in annoyance. "And what is there to
laugh at?"
</p><p>
"Ha, ha, ha! What? The angels of heaven must be
rejoicing.... Only remember, uncle, if we're taken,
don't deny what we've done. We'll have a pretty
little blaze!... Here, take the flint and steel!"
</p><p>
"Go to the devil!" answered the other. "You
sha'n't tempt me, cursed little snake! Pah! Kindle
yourself!"
</p><p>
"Ah, you're crying off..." and trembling with
rage the little man seized the big man by the beard.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
</p><p>
"I'll be the first to denounce you; I shall be believed...."
</p><p>
"Leave me alone, damn you. Give me the flint....
I've had enough of this."
</p><p>
The sparks sprang out. The smaller man, for greater
comfort, or to complete his resemblance to a young
snake, laid himself flat on his stomach. Thin tongues
of flame ran through the straw, which had been soaked
in pitch. Thick smoke arose. A mass of flame shone
ruddily on the distressed face of the giant Aragaris,
and the monkey-like visage of the little Syrian, Strombix,
who began leaping and laughing like one drunk
or mad&mdash;
</p><p>
"We'll destroy it all, in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost! Ho! ho! ho! A pretty little
blaze, eh!"
</p><p>
There was something ferocious in his destructive
glee.
</p><p>
Aragaris, pointing to the darkness, muttered&mdash;
</p><p>
"Don't you hear something?"
</p><p>
Not a soul was in the wood, but the incendiaries, in
the roaring of the wind and the moaning of the
cypresses, imagined that they heard voices.
</p><p>
Aragaris began to run.
</p><p>
"Take me on your shoulders, comrade! You've
long legs."
</p><p>
Aragaris halted; Strombix sprang on the shoulders
of the Sarmatian like a squirrel, and they fled away.
The little Syrian dug his knees into his companion's
ribs, and put his arms round his neck to avoid falling.
In spite of his fear he laughed and shouted
with joy. The pair gained the open field. Between
the clouds, the moon in its last quarter was shining,
and the wind roared harshly. Strombix on the giant's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
shoulders seemed an evil spirit riding his victim to
hell. The idea in fact suddenly struck Aragaris
that the Demon, in the shape of a great cat, was
hunting him along with his claws to the abyss. The
giant made desperate bounds to shake off his burden.
The hair bristled on his head, and he yelled with terror.
The black, double figure of the pair running, stooped
towards the dry, hard earth, over the withered fields,
was silhouetted against the pale horizon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the same hour, in his chamber in the palace at
Antioch, Julian was having a secret interview with the
prefect Sallustius Secundus&mdash;
</p><p>
"Where shall we obtain, well-beloved Cæsar, the
necessary food for such an army?"
</p><p>
"I'll send to Sicily, to Egypt, to Apulia, in all
directions where the harvests are abundant," answered
the Emperor. "I can answer for it that there will be
food enough...."
</p><p>
"And money?" asked Sallustius. "Would it not
be better to postpone this campaign till next year?
Wait a little?"
</p><p>
Julian strode up and down the room. Suddenly he
halted before the other man.
</p><p>
"Wait!" he exclaimed angrily. "One would say
the word was a kind of pass-word, it is repeated to me
so often!... Wait? As if it were possible to wait
now, to weigh, vacillate, hesitate! Are the Galileans
waiting? Understand, Senator, I must achieve the
impossible; I must return from Persia great and
terrible ... or not return at all. No more conciliations,
or half measures, are possible!... Why speak
of reason? Did the Macedonian Alexander conquer
the world by reason&mdash;the beardless young man who,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
with a mere handful of soldiers, went to fight the monarchs
of Asia? Was he not mad, in the sight of
reasonable men like you? What gave him victory?"
</p><p>
"I do not know," responded the prefect evasively.
"I suppose the valour of the hero...."
</p><p>
"No," exclaimed Julian. "The gods! Understand,
Sallustius, the Olympians can grant me the
same grace, and a greater still, if it please them. I
will cross the world from east to west, like the great
Macedonian, like the god Dionysus. When I come
back victorious from Asia we shall see what the
Christians have to say, whether they will mock at the
sword of the Roman Emperor as they mock at the plain
robe of the philosopher."
</p><p>
His eyes seemed glittering with madness; and Sallustius,
seeing that further objection was useless, said
nothing. But when Julian began to walk up and
down, the prefect shook his head and deep pity was
expressed in the kindly gaze of the old man.
</p><p>
"The army must be ready to march," continued
Julian. "I desire it, do you hear? I will have no
excuses nor delays. Arsaces, the Armenian king, has
promised help. There is bread. What more is lacking?
I must know that I can at any moment set out
against the Persians. On this depends not only my
glory, but the safety of the Roman Empire and the
victory of the gods against the Galileans!..."
</p><p>
The warm wind, blowing into the chamber, agitated
the three flames of the lampadary. A shooting-star
scored the dark blue night-sky and vanished. Julian
saw it, and was strangely thrilled.
</p><p>
Outside the door voices were heard. Someone
knocked.
</p><p>
"Who is there? Come in!" said the Emperor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
</p><p>
They were his philosopher friends. Libanius, at
their head, seemed more emphatic and sullen than
usual.
</p><p>
"What is your desire?" asked Julian coldly.
</p><p>
Libanius knelt, still retaining his arrogant air&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let me depart, Augustus. I can no longer endure
life at your Court. My patience is exhausted. Every
day there is some new insult to put up with...."
and he spoke at length of rewards, the moneys received
by him no longer, of ingratitude in view of his services,
and the splendid panegyrics with which he had glorified
Cæsar.
</p><p>
But Julian, unheeding, gazed at the celebrated orator
with disgust. Could this really be the same Libanius
whose speeches he had admired so much in youth?
What baseness! what vanity!
</p><p>
Then all the philosophers began speaking at once.
Their voices rose, they mutually accused each other of
impiety, debauchery, peculation, repeating the most
fatuous scandals. The scene was a petty civil war, not
of the wise, but between parasites waxed fat through
prosperity, ready to fly at each other's throats through
pride, anger, and idleness.
</p><p>
At last the Emperor uttered a word which brought
them back to their senses&mdash;
</p><p>
"Masters!"
</p><p>
All were silenced like so many frightened magpies.
</p><p>
"Masters!" repeated Julian, with bitter irony, "I
have heard you long enough. Permit me to relate you
a fable: 'An Egyptian king had a set of tame apes,
trained to perform a war-dance of Epirus. They were
costumed in helmets and masks; their tails were hidden
under the Imperial purple, and while they were dancing
it was difficult to believe they were not human. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
spectacle gave general delight for years. But on one
occasion one of the spectators happened to throw on the
stage a handful of nuts! And what happened? The
warriors tore off their purple and masks, readjusted
their tails, dropped on all fours, and began to bite each
other.' How do you like my fable, masters?"
</p><p>
Everybody was silent. Suddenly Sallustius took the
Emperor by the hand and pointed to the open window.
Under the sombre masses of clouds a reddish light,
tossed by a violent wind, seemed slowly spreading.
</p><p>
"Fire! fire!" all present cried.
</p><p>
"On the other side of the river," some suggested.
</p><p>
"No, at Garandâma," others cried.
</p><p>
"No, it must be at Gezireh, in the Jew quarter!"
</p><p>
"It's neither at Gezireh nor at Garandâma," exclaimed
a voice, with the exultant tone of one in a
crowd at sight of a conflagration. "It is in the wood
of Daphne!"
</p><p>
"Apollo's temple!" murmured the Emperor, whose
heart was beating wildly. "The Galileans!" he
shouted with a mad voice, rushing to the door, then to
the staircase.
</p><p>
"Slaves, ... quick! My charger and fifty legionaries!"
</p><p>
In a few moments all was ready. A black colt,
trembling all over and with a dangerous look in his
bloodshot eyes, was led into the courtyard.
</p><p>
Julian rode at a breakneck speed through the streets
of Antioch, followed by his legionaries. The crowd
scattered in terror before them. One man was knocked
down and another trampled to death, but their cries
were drowned by the thunder of hoofs and the clatter
of arms.
</p><p>
The open country was reached. Julian knew not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
how long the mad gallop lasted; three legionaries fell
with their foundered horses. The glow became brighter
and brighter and the smell of smoke perceptible. The
fields with their dusty vegetation assumed a yellowish
hue. A curious crowd rushed up from every side,
like moths to a flame. Julian noticed the joyousness
of their faces, as if they were hurrying to a
festival.
</p><p>
Tongues of flame glittered, in thick smoke-clouds,
above the wood of Daphne. The Emperor penetrated
into the sacred enclosure. There the crowd was bellowing,
and exchanging pleasantries and laughter.
</p><p>
The calm alleys, abandoned by all for so many years,
were swarming. Rioters profaned the wood, broke
down branches of ancient laurels, befouled the springs,
and trampled on the sleeping flowers. The cool odour
of narcissus and lily strove with the stifling heat of the
fire and the breath of the people.
</p><p>
"A miracle from God," murmured the crowd gleefully.
"I myself saw lightning fall from heaven and
kindle the roof!"
</p><p>
"No, thou liest! The earth split in the midst of the
temple and vomited flames underneath the idol!"
</p><p>
"'S death!... It was after the abominable order
to shift the relics. They thought they could do it
without let or hindrance.... Pooh!... So much
for your Temple of Apollo and prophecy from the
sacred spring! It is a blessing!"
</p><p>
Julian saw in the crowd a woman half-dressed, as if
newly risen from bed. With a stupid smile she was
wondering at the fire, while cradling on her arm an
infant at the breast. Tears still trembled on the eyelashes
of the little one; but he quieted himself sucking
vigorously at the breast, against which he had propped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
himself with one hand, while stretching the other towards
the flames as if for a new plaything.
</p><p>
The Emperor reined up his horse. Further advance
was impossible, by reason of the heat. The legionaries
stood awaiting orders. But Julian saw that the temple
was doomed. From base to roof it was enveloped in
flames, like an immense brazier. Walls, joists, and
carven cross-beams were falling in, with crash after
crash, and whirlwinds of sparks mounted to a sky
which came down lower and lower, lurid and menacing.
The flames seemed to lick the clouds, struggling
against the embraces of the wind and, roaring, flapped
like great sails. The laurel leaves writhed in the heat,
and doubled themselves as in torture. The peaks of
the cypresses, kindled like huge torches, gave up the
smoke of sacrifice. Drops of resin fell thickly from the
centenarian trees, old as the temple.
</p><p>
Julian gazed haggardly at the fire. He wished to
give an order to the legionaries; but drawing his sword
from the scabbard and curbing his restive horse, he
could only ejaculate impotently between clenched teeth&mdash;"Oh,
wretched, wretched people!"
</p><p>
Shouts of the crowd sounded in the distance. Julian
recollected that the entrance to the treasury was at the
back; and the idea occurred to him that the Galileans
were pillaging the wealth of the god.... He made
a sign, and dashed in that direction, followed by the
legionaries. A melancholy procession brought him to
a halt. A few Roman guards, who had run up in
haste from the village of Daphne, were carrying a rude
litter.
</p><p>
"What is it?" asked Julian.
</p><p>
"The Galileans have stoned the priest Gorgius to
death."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
</p><p>
"And the treasury?"
</p><p>
"It is untouched. Standing on the threshold of the
door, the priest defended the entrance. He never left
his post until a stone stretched him on the ground.
Then they killed the child. The Galilean horde, after
trampling them under foot, would have got into the
treasury if we hadn't arrived in time."
</p><p>
"Is he still alive?"
</p><p>
"Hardly breathing."
</p><p>
The Emperor leapt from his horse. The litter was
laid gently down; and Julian stooping, cautiously
lifted a corner of the old chlamys of the priest, which
covered both bodies. The old man was stretched with
closed eyes and scarcely heaving breast on a bed of
fresh laurel-branches. Julian's heart shook with pity
when he saw the red-nosed old drinker, whom he had
thought so scandalous a few days before. He remembered
the poor goose in the wicker basket, the last
offering to Apollo. On the snowy hair drops of blood
stood like berries, and laurel leaves enlaced lay in a
wreath on the priest's head.
</p><p>
By his side lay the little body of Hepherion, his
cheek resting on his hand. He seemed asleep. Julian
thought&mdash;
</p><p>
"Such must Eros be, son of the Love-goddess, killed
by the stones of Galileans."
</p><p>
And the Roman Emperor knelt in veneration before
the martyrs to Olympus. In spite of the loss of the
temple, in spite of the stupid triumph of the mob, Julian
felt in this death the presence of the god. His heart
softened; even his hate disappeared, and with humble
tears he kissed the old man's hand. The dying man
opened his eyes.
</p><p>
"Where is the child?" he asked under his breath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
</p><p>
"Here, near you."
</p><p>
Julian gently placed the hand of Gorgius on the
locks of Hepherion.
</p><p>
"Is he alive?" asked Gorgius, stroking the child's
curls for the last time. He was so weak that he could
not turn his head, and Julian had not the courage to
reveal the truth.
</p><p>
The priest fixed a suppliant look on the Emperor&mdash;
</p><p>
"Cæsar! I entrust him to you.... Do not
abandon him...."
</p><p>
"Be assured; I will do all that I can for the little
one."
</p><p>
So Julian took under his protection one to whom not
even a Roman Cæsar could now do good or harm.
</p><p>
Gorgius let his hand remain on the head of Hepherion.
Suddenly his face lighted; he tried to say
something, and stammered incoherently&mdash;
</p><p>
"Rejoice! Rejoice!"
</p><p>
He gazed before him with eyes wide open, sighed,
paused in the midst of the sigh, and his look faded.
Julian closed the eyes of the dead.
</p><p>
Suddenly exultant songs were heard. The Emperor
wheeled round, and saw a long procession marching
down the cypress-alley. A great crowd of priests, in
dalmatics of cloth of gold covered with precious gems,
deacons swinging censers, black monks bearing lighted
tapers, virgins and youths clothed in white, children
waving palm-branches, and above the crowd on a lofty
car the relics of Babylas, in a glittering silver shrine.
They were the relics expelled, by Cæsar's orders, from
Daphne to Antioch. The expulsion had become a
victorious march. The people were singing the ancient
Psalm of David glorifying the God of Israel&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>He is clothed in clouds and darkness!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
</p><p>
Above the moanings of the wind, and the roarings
of the fire, soared the triumphant chant of the Galileans
to the lurid vault of the sky&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Clouds and darkness surround Him, fire tramples
out His enemies before Him, and the mountains melt like
wax before the face of the Lord, the Lord of all the
earth!</i>"
</p><p>
Julian grew pale at the audacity of joy resounding
in the last line&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Let all those who serve and boast themselves of their idols tremble,
And let all gods bow down before Him!</i>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Emperor leapt upon his horse, drew his sword,
and shouted&mdash;
</p><p>
"Soldiers, follow me!"
</p><p>
He was about to rush in, disperse the triumphant
mob, overset the shrine, and scatter the bones of the
saint, but a firm hand seized the bridle of his horse&mdash;
</p><p>
"Out of the way!" cried Julian furiously, lifting
his sword.
</p><p>
Next moment his arm fell. Before him stood the
stern, calm face of Sallustius Secundus, who had just
arrived from Antioch.
</p><p>
"Cæsar, do not strike the unarmed! Be yourself!"
</p><p>
Julian put back his sword in the scabbard.
</p><p>
His helmet scorched his head; he tore it off and
flung it to earth, wiping away great drops of sweat.
Alone and bareheaded he advanced towards the crowd,
signing them to halt.
</p><p>
"Inhabitants of Antioch," he said almost calmly,
restraining himself by a supreme effort, "know that
the rioters, and setters on fire of the Temple of Apollo,
will be punished without mercy. You scorn my pity?
We shall see how you will scorn my anger. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Roman Augustus could blot your town from the earth,
so that men should forget that Antioch the great ever
existed. But I go forth to war against the Persians.
If the gods grant that I return in triumph, woe be to
you, rioters! Woe to thee, Nazarene, the carpenter's
son!"
</p><p>
And he stretched out his sword above the heads of
the crowd.
</p><p>
Suddenly he fancied he heard a voice saying&mdash;
</p><p>
"The Nazarene, son of the carpenter, makes ready
thy shroud!"
</p><p>
Julian thrilled, turned round, but saw no one. He
passed his hand over his eyes. Was it an hallucination?
At that moment from the interior of the temple
came a deafening noise. Part of the roof had fallen on
the statue of Apollo, which reeled from its pedestal.
The procession went on its way, taking up again the
Psalm&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"<i>Let those tremble who serve and boast themselves of their idols,
And let all gods of the earth bow down before Him!</i>"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span></p></blockquote>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIV</h2>

<p>Julian passed the winter in preparations for his
Persian campaign. At the beginning of spring,
on the fifth of March, he quitted Antioch with an army
of sixty-five thousand men. The snow was melting
from the mountains. In fruit-gardens the leafless
young apricot trees were trimmed with pink blossoms.
The soldiery marched gaily to the war as to a festival.
</p><p>
The dockyards of Samos had built a fleet of twelve
hundred ships, wrought of enormous cedars, pine, and
oak from Taurus gorges, and the fleet had ascended
the Euphrates as far as the city of Leontopolis.
</p><p>
By forced marches Julian passed by Hieropolis to
Carrhæ, and thence along the Euphrates as far as the
southern Persian frontier. In the north, another army
of thirty thousand men had been sent out under the
generals Procopius and Sebastian. Joined to the forces
of the Armenian Arsaces, these were to lay waste Adiabene,
Apolloniatis, and traversing Corduene rejoin the
principal army on the banks of the Tigris at Ctesiphon.
</p><p>
All had been provided for, combined and planned
with ardour by the Emperor himself. Those who
understood the plan of campaign were amazed, and
not without reason, at its wisdom, simplicity, and
greatness of conception.
</p><p>
At the beginning of April, the army reached Circesium,
a post remarkably fortified by Diocletian on
the frontier of Mesopotamia, at the junction of the
Araxes and the Euphrates. There a bridge of boats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
was constructed, Julian having given the order to
cross the frontier on the following morning. Late that
evening, when all was ready, he returned to his tent,
fatigued but satisfied. He lit his lamp in order to resume
his favourite work, for which part of his night
was reserved. It was a study in pure philosophy:
<i>Against the Christians</i>. He used to write it in
snatches, within sound of the trumpets and camp-songs
and challenging sentries. He rejoiced in the idea that
he was fighting the Galilean with every weapon lying
to his hand; by battlefield and book, by Roman sword
and Hellenic learning. Never did the Emperor part
with the works of the Fathers, ecclesiastical canons
and creeds of the councils. On the margin of the New
Testament, which he studied with no less care than
Plato and Homer, he would make caustic annotations
with his own hand.
</p><p>
Julian took off his dusty armour, sat down before
his table, and dipping his reed-pen in ink, began to
write. His leisure was immediately invaded. Two
couriers had just arrived in camp, one from Italy, the
other from Jerusalem. Their news was by no means
agreeable. An earthquake had destroyed the city of
Nicomedia in Asia Minor, and subterranean rumblings
had raised to the highest pitch the terror of the inhabitants
of Constantinople. The books of the sibyls,
moreover, forebade the crossing of the frontiers before
the year had elapsed. The courier from Jerusalem
brought a letter from the dignitary Alipius of Antioch.
By a strange contradiction Julian, the worshipper of
the manifold Olympus, had decided to rebuild the
temple, destroyed by the Romans, of the one God of
Israel, in order to refute, in the face of time and the
world, the prophecy of the Gospel, "<i>There shall not be</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
<i>left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown
down</i>" (Matt. xxiv. 2). The Jews responded with
enthusiasm to the Emperor's appeal. Gifts flowed in
from all sides. The plan of rebuilding was a superb
one. The work was promptly taken in hand, and Julian
confided the general supervision to his friend, the
learned and noble Alipius of Antioch, formerly proconsul
of Britain.
</p><p>
"What has happened?" asked Julian, before unsealing
the missive, perturbed at the sombre face of the
courier.
</p><p>
"A great misfortune, well-beloved Cæsar!"
</p><p>
"Speak, fear nothing."
</p><p>
"So long as the workmen were working at the ruins
and demolishing the old walls, all went well. But
hardly had they proceeded to lay the first stone of the
new edifice, when flames, in the shape of balls of fire,
escaped from the vaults, overturned the blocks, and
scorched the workmen. On the following day, on the
order of the most noble Alipius, the works were resumed.
The miracle was repeated, and so also a third
time. The Christians are triumphant; the Hellenes
in despair; and not a single workman will consent to
go down into the vaults. Nothing remains of the
edifice, not one stone!"
</p><p>
"Hush, fool! You must be a Galilean yourself!" exclaimed
the Emperor. "These are old wives' tales!"
</p><p>
He broke the seal, unfolded, and read the letter.
The courier spoke the truth. Alipius confirmed his
words. Julian could not believe his eyes. He re-read
the message carefully, bringing it nearer to the lamp.
His face flushed with anger and shame. He bit his
lips and threw the crumpled papyrus to the physician
Oribazius, who stood hard by.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
</p><p>
"Read!... Either Alipius has gone mad, or indeed....
No! that's impossible!"
</p><p>
The young Alexandrian doctor picked up and read
the letter with the calmness which never deserted him.
Lifting his clear and intelligent eyes to Julian's, he
answered&mdash;
</p><p>
"I see in this no miracle. Scientific men described
the phenomenon long ago. In the vaults of old buildings
which have been sealed from the air for centuries,
there collects a dense inflammable gas. To go with a
lighted torch into these vaults is enough to explain the
explosion and kill the rash workman. To the ignorant
and superstitious this of course appears a miracle, but
it is perfectly natural and explicable."
</p><p>
He laid the letter on the table with a slightly pedantic
smile on his thin lips.
</p><p>
"Ah, yes! to be sure," said Julian, not without
bitterness. "The earthquakes at Nicomedia and
Constantinople, the prophecies of the sibylline books,
drought at Antioch, conflagrations at Rome, inundations
in Egypt, all are perfectly natural! Only it is
odd that everything is in league against me, earth and
water, fire and sky, and even the gods, I believe!"
</p><p>
Sallustius Secundus came into the tent.
</p><p>
"Sublime Augustus! Tuscan wizards, charged by
you to ascertain the will of the gods, beg you to wait;
not to cross the frontier to-morrow. The birds of the
oracles, despite all prayers, refuse food, and will not
even pick at the grains of barley!"
</p><p>
At first Julian frowned angrily, but his face immediately
brightened, and he burst into a surprising fit of
laughter.
</p><p>
"Really, Sallustius? They won't peck at anything,
eh? Then what must we do with these obstinate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
beasts? Suppose we retrace our steps to Antioch, amid
the laughter of the Galileans?... My dear friend,
go back immediately to these Tuscan wizards and tell
them my will. Let the fowls be thrown into the river.
Do you understand? These pampered birds are not
pleased to eat. Let's see if they will drink....
Carry my orders."
</p><p>
"Is this some jest, Cæsar? Do I understand you
rightly? In spite of everything, we are to cross the
frontier to-morrow?"
</p><p>
"Yes! And I swear by my next victory, and the
greatness of Rome, that no prophetic bird shall daunt
me, neither water, earth, nor fire, not even the gods!
It is too late! The die is cast. My friends, is there
anything in all nature superior to the will of man? In
all the sibylline books is there anything stronger than
the words 'I will'? More than ever I feel the mystery
of my life. No auguries shall enmesh me. To-day I
believe in, and yet I laugh at them. Is it sacrilege?
So much the worse. I have nothing to lose! If the
gods abandon me I will deny them!"
</p><p>
When everybody had gone out, Julian approached
the little statue of Mercury, with the intention of praying,
as he usually did, and casting some grains of incense
on the tripod; but suddenly he turned away with
a smile, lay down on the lion-skin which served him as
bed, and extinguishing the lamp fell into a deep and
careless slumber, as folk often do on the brink of misfortune.
</p><p>
Dawn had hardly risen when he awoke in higher
spirits than on the evening before. The trumpet
sounded. Julian leapt on horseback and rode to the
banks of the Araxes. It was a cool April morning.
A gentle wind bore the nocturnal desert warmth from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
the banks of the great Asiatic river. All along the
Euphrates, from Circesium as far as the Roman camp,
stretched the fleet, over a space of nearly two miles.
Since the reign of Xerxes no such display of forces had
ever been seen here. The sun's first rays glittered
behind the mausoleum raised to Gordian, the conqueror
of the Persians, killed in that place by the Arab Philip.
The edge of the purple disk rose from the desert like
a burning coal, and all the tops of the masts and sails
grew red in the morning fog. The Emperor raised his
hand, and the earth-shaking mass of sixty-five thousand
men began the march. The Roman army began
to cross the bridge that separated it from the Persian
frontier. Julian's horse carried him over the bridge
and up a high sandy hill on the enemy's soil. The
centurion of the Imperial Guard, Anatolius, the admirer
of Arsinoë, marched at the head of the palatine
cohort.
</p><p>
Anatolius looked at the Emperor. A great change
had come over Julian during the month passed in the
open air, amidst the healthy toils of campaigning. It
was difficult to recognise in this masculine warrior, so
hale of visage, whose young glance was brilliant with
gaiety, the thin and yellow-faced philosopher, dull-eyed,
ragged-bearded, nervous in movement, with ink-stained
fingers and toga, Julian the rhetorician, who
had served as butt for the street-boys of Antioch.
</p><p>
"Hark! hark! Cæsar is going to speak!"
</p><p>
All was silent. The clink of arms, the noise of
waves lapping sides of ships, and the silky rustle of the
standards were the only sounds audible.
</p><p>
"Warriors, my bravest of the brave," said Julian in
his strong voice, "I read such gaiety, such boldness
on your faces, that I cannot help addressing you some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
words of welcome. Remember, comrades, the destiny
of the world is in our hands! We are going to restore
the old greatness of Rome! Steel your hearts; be
ready for any fate. There is to be no turning back.
</p><p>
"I shall be at your head, on horseback or on foot,
taking all dangers and toils with the humblest among
you; because, henceforth, you are no longer my servants,
but my children and my friends! If fate kills
me, happy shall I be to die for our great Rome, like
Scævola and the Curiatii and the noblest of the Decii.
Courage, then, my comrades! and remember that the
strong are always conquerors!"
</p><p>
He stretched his sword, with a smile, toward the
distant horizon. The soldiers in unison held up their
bucklers, shouting in rapture&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory, glory to conquering Cæsar!"
</p><p>
The galleys glided down the reaches of the river.
The Roman eagles hovered above their cohorts, and
the Emperor rode on his white horse, to meet the rising
sun, across the cold blue shadow, on the desert sand,
cast from the pyramid of Gordian. Soon, soon was
Julian to quit the light of day for the long shadow of
the solitary grave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XV</h2>

<p>The army was marching along the left bank of the
Euphrates; on the broad plain, level as the sea,
and covered with silvery wormwood, not a tree was
in sight. On all sides lay grass and sweet-smelling
bushes. From time to time, troops of wild asses appeared
on the horizon, raising clouds of dust. Ostriches
were seen running; and the soldiers used to
roast the delicate flesh of the bustard at their camp-fires.
Jests and songs lasted till night-fall. The desert
received these soldiers, hungry for glory, booty, and
blood, with mute caresses, starry nights, gentle dawns
and sunsets, night-coolnesses breathing the bitter smell
of wormwood. Deeper and deeper they plunged into
the solitudes, without meeting the enemy. Hardly had
they passed when calm descended on the plain, as on
the sea over a sunken ship; and the grass, trampled
by the legionaries, lifted up anew its soft spears.
</p><p>
Suddenly the desert became menacing. Clouds hid
the sky; rains began; and a soldier watering his
horses was killed by lightning. At the end of April
came the heats. Soldiers envied their comrades who
marched in the shadow of a dromedary or of a wagon.
The men of the north, Gauls and Sicambri, began to
die of sunstroke. The plains became sad, bare, tufted
here and there with scorched grass, and every step sank
into the sand. Fierce gusts of wind assailed the army,
tearing the standards from their poles, and blowing
away tents. Then again a calm was restored which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
in its strangeness and profundity, seemed to the frightened
soldiers more terrible than tempest. Raillery
and marching-songs ceased; but the march went on,
day after day; and yet they never caught a glimpse
of the enemy.
</p><p>
At the beginning of May the palm-groves of Assyria
were reached.
</p><p>
At Mazeprakt, where lay ruins of the enormous wall
constructed by ancient Syrian kings, the enemy was
seen for the first time. The Persians hastily retreated,
and under a rain of poisoned arrows the Romans
crossed the wide canal joining the Euphrates to the
Tigris. This magnificent piece of engineering, made
of Babylonian brick, cutting Mesopotamia in two, was
called Nazar Malka, the River of Kings. Suddenly
the Persians disappeared. The waters of the Nazar
Malka rose, overflowed the banks, and flooded the vast
surrounding plains. The Persians had organised the
inundation by opening the sluices and dykes which lay
on all sides, threatening the friable wastes. The foot-soldiers
marched on, up to the knees in water, and
their legs sank deep into mud. Entire companies disappeared
into invisible ditches. Even horsemen and
dromedaries with their burdens vanished suddenly.
The track had to be sounded for with poles. The
whole desert was transformed into a lake, and the
palm-groves appeared like islands.
</p><p>
"Whither are we going?" the cowardly began to
murmur. "Why not retire at once to the river, and
get on shipboard? We are soldiers; not frogs made
for dabbling through mud!"
</p><p>
Julian marched on foot with the infantry, even in the
most difficult places. He helped to haul the labouring
chariots out of mud-holes by their wheels; and laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
at his own soaked and clay-stained purple. Fascines
and floating bridges were formed of palm stems; and
at night-fall the army succeeded in reaching a dry
place. The soldiers fell asleep, utterly exhausted.
</p><p>
In the morning they saw the fortress of Perizaborh.
</p><p>
From the tops of walls and inaccessible towers,
spread with thick carpets and goat-skins, to defend
them from the shock of siege-weapons, the Persians
poured down scorn upon their enemies.
</p><p>
The whole day passed in the exchange of insults and
projectiles. Then, profiting by the darkness of a moonless
night, the Romans, in absolute silence, carried the
catapults and battering-ram from their ships (which
had all this way accompanied the march) and propped
these weapons against the walls of Perizaborh. The
fosses were filled with earth, and by means of a <i>malleolus</i>,
or enormous spindle-shaped arrow, full of an inflammable
matter, made of pitch, sulphur, oil, and
bitumen, the Romans succeeded in setting the goatskin
carpets on fire.
</p><p>
The Persians rushed to extinguish the conflagration,
and profiting by the momentary confusion the Emperor
ordered an attack by the great battering-ram. This
was a huge pine-stem, swung by chains from a pyramidal
tower of beams, and pointed by a ram's head in
metal. A hundred strong legionaries, hauling in
rhythm on thick ropes made of ox-sinew, slowly
heaved and balanced the enormous shaft. The first
blow sounded like the rumbling of thunder. Earth
shook and the walls resounded. The furious ram
butted his metal head in a swift and tremendous succession
of blows against the walls. There was a great
crash; an entire corner of the wall had given way.
The Persians, with despairing cries, fled in all directions;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
and Julian, the star of whose helmet glittered
through clouds of dust, bright and terrible as the star
of Mars, galloped into the conquered town.
</p><p>
For two days the army rested under the fresh and
shadowy groves on the other side of the city; the men
regaling themselves with a kind of wine made of
palm-juice, and amber-clear dates from Babylon.
</p><p>
Then they resumed their march and entered a rocky
plain.
</p><p>
The heat was painful. Men and horses died in great
numbers. At noon the air danced above the rocks in
burning rays, and through the ashen-grey desert
wound the silvery waves of Tigris, like a lazy serpent
basking his coils in the sun.
</p><p>
The Romans saw at length, beyond the Tigris, a
lofty rock rising, rose-coloured, bare and jagged. This
was the second fortress defending Ctesiphon, the
southern capital of Persia. It was a place far more
difficult to take than Perizaborh, and soared to the
clouds like an eagle's nest.
</p><p>
The sixteen towers and double enclosing walls of
Maogamalki were built with the famous bricks of
Babylon, sun-dried and mortared with bitumen, like all
the ancient monuments of Assyria, which fear not the
centuries.
</p><p>
The attack commenced. Again the ungainly slings
groaned, and the pulleys of <i>scorpions</i> and <i>onagers</i>, or
frames for flinging stones. Again huge flaming beams
hissed like arrows from their engines. At the hour
when even lizards go to sleep in fissures of the rock,
the sun-rays fell vertically on the backs and heads of
soldiers, stifling them like a crushing weight. The
desperate legionaries, in defiance of their officers and of
increased danger, snatched off their helmets and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
bloodied armour, preferring the chance of wounds to
enduring that fearful heat. Above the brown towers
and loopholes of Maogamalki, vomiting poisoned
arrows, lances, stones, leaden bullets, and Persian fire-darts
of choking sulphur, stretched the dazzling blue-grey
of a dusty sky, blind and implacable as death.
</p><p>
The heavens beat down the hatred of men. Besiegers
and besieged, utterly exhausted, ceased fighting. And
a silence of noon-day, more sullen than the blackest
night, fell on both hosts.
</p><p>
The Romans lost no whit of their courage. After
the taking of Perizaborh they believed in the invincibility
of the Emperor, compared him to Alexander the
Great, and expected miracles from him.
</p><p>
For several days, on the east side of Maogamalki
where the rocky steep was less abrupt, soldiers were
set to hollow a tunnel. This mine, passing under the
walls of the fortress, led up to the centre of the town.
The width of the passage&mdash;three cubits&mdash;allowed two
soldiers to proceed abreast. Huge beams at intervals
supported the ceiling. The diggers worked gaily.
The damp and obscurity seemed delicious to them
after the excess of sunlight.
</p><p>
"A day or two ago we were frogs and now we're
moles," said the soldiers to each other, laughing.
</p><p>
Three cohorts, the Mattiarians, Lactiniarians, and
Victorians, fifteen hundred picked men, keeping the
sternest silence, crawled into the subterranean passage,
impatiently waiting orders to burst into the town. At
daybreak the attack was expressly directed on two
opposite sides, in order to divert the attention of the
Persians, and Julian himself led up the soldiers by a
single narrow path under a hail of stones and arrows.
</p><p>
"We shall see," he said to himself with glee at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
danger; "we shall see if the gods preserve me, or if,
by a miracle, I shall escape death even now."
</p><p>
Some irresistible curiosity, or thirst for the supernatural,
urged him to expose himself, and with a defiant
smile to challenge Fate to do her worst. It was not
death he feared, but only defeat in his purposeless and
intoxicating game against the higher powers.
</p><p>
The soldiers followed him on, fascinated by and
catching the contagion of his mad mood.
</p><p>
Meantime the Persians, laughing at the efforts of the
besiegers, were singing on the battlements songs in
glory of King Sapor, "Son of the Sun." And from
the precipitous terraces they shouted to the Romans:
</p><p>
"Julian will scale the heavenly palace of Ormuzd
before he gets into our fortress!"
</p><p>
When the fire of action had risen to its hottest, the
Emperor, in a low voice, sent word to his officers on
the far side of the city.
</p><p>
The legionaries hidden in the tunnel burst out into
the interior of the city, and found themselves in the
cellar of a house where an old Persian woman was
kneading bread. She uttered a piercing cry at the
sight of the Roman legionaries, and was promptly
killed. Then, gliding unperceived, they threw themselves
on the rear of the besieged. The Persians flung
down their arms, and scattered into the streets. The
Romans then rushed to the city gates, and by the
double assault the town was taken. From that moment
not a legionary doubted that the Emperor, like
Alexander of Macedon, would conquer the whole of the
Persian Empire as far as the Indies.
</p><p>
Leaving its larger ships behind on the Euphrates,
the army now drew near to Ctesiphon, on the river
Tigris. But Julian, whose almost unnaturally feverish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
imagination gave his enemies no time to recover, made
practicable the old Roman canal, hollowed by Trajan
and Septimius Severus between the Tigris and the Euphrates;
the same channel that had been filled in and
flooded by the Persians. By this means the whole fleet
left the Euphrates and reached the Tigris a little above
Ctesiphon. The conqueror found himself thus at the
centre of the Asiatic Empire.
</p><p>
On the following day Julian summoned a council of
war and declared that the troops should be transported
that night to the other bank, under the walls of the
capital. Dagalaïf, Hormizdas, Secundinus, Victor,
Sallustius, all seasoned warriors, were terrified at this
idea. For hours they strove to persuade the Emperor
to relinquish so rash a project, urging the fatigue of
the soldiers, the width and rapid currents of the river,
the steepness of the banks, the proximity of Ctesiphon,
and the innumerable army of Sapor; the Persians being
certain to make a sortie at the moment of disembarkation.
Julian would listen to nothing.
</p><p>
"Wait as long as we will," he exclaimed impatiently,
"the river will not grow narrower nor the
banks less steep; and the Persian army will get bigger
every day we delay. If I had listened to your advice,
we should still be at Antioch."
</p><p>
The chiefs left his tent in consternation.
</p><p>
"He cannot last long in this mood," murmured the
well-tried and wily Dagalaïf, a Goth grown old in the
service of Rome. "Remember what I tell you. He
seems gay, and even laughs, but there is something
ill in his expression. I've seen it in people who are
close to despair or death. That gaiety augurs evil."
</p><p>
The warm misty twilight descended rapidly on the
immense river-reaches. At a given signal five galleys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
bearing four hundred warriors, were unlashed from
their moorings, and for long nothing was heard but the
regular dip of their muffled oars. Then, silence. The
obscurity became impenetrable. Julian gazed fixedly
in the direction in which the boats had disappeared,
concealing his emotion under affected cheerfulness.
The generals muttered among themselves. Suddenly
a blaze lit up the night. Everyone drew his breath,
and all looks were turned on the Emperor. He understood
what that blaze meant. The Persians had
succeeded in setting light to the Roman ships, by
means of fire-balls hurled from engines on the other
bank.
</p><p>
Julian grew pale, but immediately collecting himself
and giving his soldiers no time to think, he rushed into
the first ship lying along shore and shouted to the
army&mdash;
</p><p>
"Victory, victory! Do you see that fire? They
have landed and are masters of the bank. I myself
ordered the cohorts to light the bonfire as a signal of
success. Follow me, comrades!"
</p><p>
"What is this?" muttered the prudent Sallustius
in his ear. "All is lost; that fire is on board our
galleys...."
</p><p>
"Cæsar has gone mad!" groaned the terrified Hormizdas
to Dagalaïf. That wily barbarian shrugged his
shoulders in perplexity.
</p><p>
With an irresistible impulse the legions dashed down
to the river, all ranks elbowing each other and shouting
"Victory! victory!" Jostling, falling into the
water, dragging each other out, the men swarmed on
board.
</p><p>
A few small boats nearly sank; and there was no
room on the galleys to take over all. Many cavalry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
swam across, hanging to the manes and tails of their
horses. The Celts and Batavians flung themselves into
the water, pushing over, afloat, their great hollowed
leather shields. Through fog they swam, many being
caught and whirled round in eddies, but regardless of
danger they too shouted "Victory, victory!" from the
water. So great was the number of ships that the current
was slightly broken, thus aiding the swimmers.
The conflagration of the first five galleys was extinguished
without difficulty. Then only did all ranks
understand the Emperor's audacious ruse. But the
spirit of the soldiers rose still higher after the avoidance
of such a danger. Now everything seemed possible.
</p><p>
A little before dawn they made themselves masters
of the heights of the far bank, but hardly had the Romans
time for a brief rest on their arms when they saw
at daybreak a vast army sally from the walls of Ctesiphon
into the plain round the city.
</p><p>
The battle lasted twelve hours. The Persians fought
with the fierceness of despair. Julian's army here saw
for the first time the great war-elephants which could
crush a cohort like a tuft of grass. Never had the
Romans won such a victory since the great days of the
Emperors Trajan, Vespasian, and Titus.
</p><p>
On the following morning at daybreak Julian
brought a grateful offering to Ares, the god of war. It
consisted of ten white bulls, beautiful beasts like those
on the old Greek bas-reliefs. The whole army was
given up to merrymaking. Only the Tuscan wizards,
who at every victory of Julian's had become more sombre,
mute, and enigmatic, remained obstinately sullen.
</p><p>
The first bull, arrayed with laurels, was led to the
smoking altar. He walked slowly and passively.
Suddenly he stumbled to his knees, lowing pitifully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
almost humanly, so that a thrill ran through the spectators;
and then, burying his muzzle in the dust,
shuddered. Before the axe of the slayer had touched
his forehead he had reeled over and died. A second
bull similarly fell dead, then a third and a fourth. All
paced weakly to the altar, seeming hardly able to stand
upright, as if attacked by some mortal malady.
</p><p>
The army was in dismay at the presage. Some said
that the Etruscan wizards had poisoned the bulls, to
revenge themselves for the Emperor's contempt for
their art. Nine bulls thus fell, and the tenth, snapping
his bonds, escaped, and rushed bellowing through
the camp beyond hope of recapture.
</p><p>
The ceremonial became disorganised, and the augurs
smiled among themselves a satisfied smile. When the
entrails of the dead bulls were opened Julian, being
skilled in magic, saw at a glance terrifying omens in
the organs. He turned aside, his brow dark with
wrath, attempting but failing to assume carelessness.
</p><p>
Turning again he approached the altar and spurned
it violently with his foot. The altar reeled, but did
not fall. The crowd uttered deep sighs and the prefect
Sallustius rushed towards the Emperor, whispering&mdash;
</p><p>
"The men are looking! It would be better to cut
short the sacrifice...."
</p><p>
Julian waved him away, and overturned the altar
with his foot. The embers were scattered and the fire
extinguished, but the fragrant smoke still thickly ascended.
</p><p>
"Woe, woe upon us! The altar is profaned!"
groaned a voice.
</p><p>
"I tell you he is mad," growled Hormizdas, grasping
Dagalaïf's arm. "Look at him.... How is it
that the rest don't see it?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
</p><p>
The Etruscan augurs watched the proceedings, motionless,
with imperturbable faces.
</p><p>
Julian's eyes kindled and he raised his arms to the
sky. He cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"I swear by the eternal joy, locked here, in my
heart, I renounce You, as you have renounced me! I
abandon you as you have abandoned me, impotent
Deities! Single-handed against you, phantom Olympians,
I am like unto you, but not your equal, because
I am a man and you are only gods!... Long, long
has my heart aspired to this deliverance; and now I
break our alliance, laugh at my superstitious terrors,
at your childish oracles. I was living like a slave, and
I might have died a slave! I understand that I am
stronger than the gods, because, vowed to death, I
have conquered death! No melancholy, no fear, no
victims, no prayer! All that is past. Henceforth in
my life there shall not be a single shade, nor trembling.
Nothing! except that everlasting Olympian
smile which I have learnt from you, the Dead!
Nothing, but the sacred fire of which I rob you, O
Immortals! Mine be the cloudless sky in which you
have dwelt till now, and from which you have died, to
give place to man-gods! Maximus! Maximus! you
were right; over my soul your mind hovers still...."
</p><p>
An augur of ninety years old put his hand on the
shoulder of the Emperor.
</p><p>
"Speak lower, my son, speak lower. If thou hast
understood the mystery, rejoice in silence! Tempt
not the crowd. Those who hear thee cannot understand."
</p><p>
The general murmurs of indignation became louder.
</p><p>
"He's raving," said Hormizdas to Dagalaïf.
"Take him to his tent, or all will go ill!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
</p><p>
Oribazius, like the devoted physician that he was,
took Julian's hand and began to persuade him soothingly.
</p><p>
"Well-beloved Augustus, you must take rest. There
are dangerous fevers in this country. Come into the
tent. The sun is hurtful.... Your illness may get
worse!"
</p><p>
The Emperor looked at him with a pre-occupied air.
</p><p>
"Stay, Oribazius, I have forgotten something....
Ah, yes, yes!... It is the chiefest thing of all!
Listen. Say not, 'The gods are no more,' but rather
'The gods as yet are not.' They are not, but they
shall exist; not in fables, but on earth. We shall all
be gods, all; only to become so we must create in ourselves
such daring as no man has yet felt, not even
Alexander!"
</p><p>
The agitation of the army became more pronounced.
Murmurs and exclamations joined into a general hum
of indignation. No one clearly understood; but
everyone had a suspicion that something abnormal
was going on.
</p><p>
Some cried:
</p><p>
"Sacrilege! Set up the altar again!"
</p><p>
Others answered:
</p><p>
"The sacrificial priests have poisoned Cæsar because
he would not listen to them! Let us kill them! They
are bringing ruin on us!"
</p><p>
The Galileans took advantage of the occasion, and
slipped about from group to group, whispering and inventing
pieces of scandal.
</p><p>
"Were you watching the Emperor? It is the chastisement
of God on him. Devils have seized him and
troubled his mind. That's why he revolts against his
own gods. He has renounced the One God!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
</p><p>
As if awaking from a deep sleep, the Emperor looked
slowly over the crowd, and at last asked Oribazius, indifferently:
</p><p>
"What is the matter&mdash;these shouts? What has
happened? Ah, yes!... the altar upset!"
</p><p>
And contemplating the extinct embers with a sad
smile he said:
</p><p>
"Do you know, my learned friends, one cannot
offend people more than by telling them the truth!...
Poor simple children!... Well, let them cry, let
them weep, they will get over it! Come, Oribazius, we
will go into the shade. You are right, the sun is dangerous.
I am tired, and my eyes hurt me...."
</p><p>
Julian went slowly away leaning on the arm of the
doctor. At the door of his tent he made a languid sign
that all should leave him. The door-curtain was lowered,
and the tent plunged in darkness.
</p><p>
The Emperor went up to the camp-bed, a lion's skin,
and sank on it exhausted. He remained stretched
thus a long time, holding his head tightly in his
hands, as in childhood, after some fit of anger or disappointment.
</p><p>
"Quiet! quiet! Cæsar is ill!" the generals said, to
calm the soldiers.
</p><p>
And the men were immediately dumb.
</p><p>
Throughout the Roman camp, as in the chamber of
the dying, reigned the silence of painful expectation.
The Galileans alone took time by the forelock, gliding
furtively hither and thither, penetrating everywhere,
hawking about sinister rumours, and, like reptiles
waked by the sun's warmth after their winter's sleep,
ceaselessly whispered:
</p><p>
"Do you not understand? This is the punishment
of God on him!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XVI</h2>

<p>More than once did Oribazius prudently lift the
door-curtain, bringing refreshing drink to the
sick man. Julian refused it, and kept asking to be left
alone. He feared human faces, noise, and light. Keeping
his hands pressed against his head, and closing his
eyes, he endeavoured to keep his mind a blank; to forget
where he was, to forget every emotion. The protracted
effort of will sustained during the last three
months had changed him, and left him weak and
broken, as after a long illness. He knew not whether
he was asleep or awake. Visionary scenes, trains of
pictures glided before his eyes one after another with
amazing swiftness and intolerable precision. Sometimes
he fancied he was in bed, in the great hall at
Macellum. Old Labda had given him her blessing for
the night. The snortings of the horses picketed near
the tent became the dull snoring of Mardonius,
which the boys used to laugh at.
</p><p>
He felt happy and again a young boy, unknown by
anyone, far from the world, hidden amongst the Cappadocian
mountains.
</p><p>
He smelt the fresh and subtle smell of hyacinths, in
the first warmth of the March sun, within the little
courtyard of the priest Olympiodorus. He heard
the silver laughter of Amaryllis and the murmur of the
fountain, the metallic clink of the cottabos, and the
voice of Diaphane: "Children, the gingerbread cakes
are ready!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
</p><p>
Then all vanished.
</p><p>
Then the only sound he heard was of the first flies,
humming in a nook out of the wind, on the white
warm-sunned wall, by the seashore. And he was
blissfully watching sails bathed in the infinite softness
of the blue Propontic Sea, and he believed himself alone
in a delicious solitude, undisturbed by a single face,
and, like the little dancing gnats of the white wall, luxuriated
in sheer happiness of living, in the sunlight, in
the calm.
</p><p>
Suddenly, half-waking, Julian remembers that he is
in the heart of Persia; that he is the Roman Emperor;
that he alone is responsible for the lives of sixty thousand
legionaries; that the gods are no more, that he
has thrown down the altar of sacrifice. He shivers,
and an icy chillness invades his body. He is falling,
falling through the void, with nothing, nothing in the
universe to arrest his fall.
</p><p>
Perhaps an hour, perhaps twenty-four hours, may
have elapsed in this kind of half-slumber.
</p><p>
Then no longer dreaming, but in reality, he hears
his faithful slave saying, as he thrusts his head under
the door-curtain:
</p><p>
"Cæsar, I am afraid of disturbing you, but I dare
not disobey. It was your order that you should be
immediately informed.... The chief Ariphas has
just arrived in the camp...."
</p><p>
"Ariphas!" exclaimed Julian, rising, "Ariphas!...
Bring him, bring him here quickly!"
</p><p>
This was one of his bravest commanders, sent with a
detachment to ascertain whether the auxiliary army of
thirty thousand men, under the command of Procopius
and Sebastian, was not coming, with the troops of his
ally Arsaces, to join the Emperor under the walls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Ctesiphon. Julian had long been awaiting this help,
on which the fate of the principal army depended.
</p><p>
"Bring him!" exclaimed the Emperor ... "or no,
I myself will...."
</p><p>
But his weakness was not yet dissipated, despite this
momentary over-excitement. His head swam, he
closed his eyes and had to support himself against the
canvas wall of the tent.
</p><p>
"Give me wine ... strong wine ... mixed with
cold water."
</p><p>
The old slave rapidly executed the order, and gave
the cup to the Emperor, who drank slowly and issued
from the tent. It was late in the evening. A storm
had passed far into the distance across the Euphrates,
and the wind was still fresh with the smell of rain.
Rare stars, trembling like watchlights in the breeze,
shone in the gapped cloud. From the desert came up
the barkings of jackals. Julian laid bare his breast,
held his forehead in the wind, surrendering himself to
the soft breath of the sinking gale.
</p><p>
He smiled at the thought of his own cowardice. His
weakness had disappeared, strength returned to him.
He was sensible of the tension of his own nerves, and
felt eager to command, to act, to pass the night without
sleep, to battle and play with life and death, and
again to conquer peril. Only from time to time was he
conscious of shivering.
</p><p>
Ariphas came.
</p><p>
The news was lamentable. All hope in the help of
Procopius and Sebastian was lost. The Emperor was
abandoned by his allies in the middle of Asia. There
was even reason to suspect treason on the part of the
wily Arsaces.
</p><p>
At this moment it was announced that a deserter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
from the camp of Sapor desired to speak with the
Emperor.
</p><p>
This Persian prostrated himself before Julian and
kissed the earth.
</p><p>
His body was monstrous. His hideous head had
been disfigured by Asiatic torture. The ears cut off,
and the nostrils torn from the face, made his visage like
that of a human skull. But the eyes were bright, intelligent,
and resolute.
</p><p>
He was robed in rich fire-coloured silk, spoke Greek
villainously, and was accompanied by two slaves.
</p><p>
The Persian called himself Artaban, a satrap calumniated
to Sapor, who had therefore tortured him. He
had come to the Romans, he said, for revenge on his
own king.
</p><p>
"O Lord of the Universe!" said Artaban, with fallacious
emphasis, "I will deliver Sapor up to thee,
bound hand and foot, like a sacrificial lamb. I will
lead thee by night to the camp and softly shalt thy
hand take the king, as children take young birds in
their snares. Only hearken to Artaban: Artaban has
plenitude of power, and knows the king's secrets."
</p><p>
"What reward do you expect from me?" asked
Julian.
</p><p>
"Vengeance! Come with me!"
</p><p>
"Whither?"
</p><p>
"To the north; through the desert&mdash;three hundred
and twenty-five parasangs&mdash;then through the mountains
eastward, straight on Susa and Ecbatana...."
</p><p>
The Persian pointed to the horizon.
</p><p>
"Over there, over there," he repeated, fixing his
eyes on Julian.
</p><p>
"Cæsar," said Hormizdas to the Emperor, "take
care!... I don't like this man's face! He's a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
sorcerer&mdash;a brigand, or perhaps much worse?...
Sometimes queer things happen in these latitudes. Get
rid of him!... Don't listen to him...."
</p><p>
Julian paid no heed to the words of Hormizdas.
</p><p>
He felt the strange fascination of the Persian's supplicating
eyes.
</p><p>
"Do you know every step of the road which leads
to Ecbatana?"
</p><p>
"Oh yes! yes!" exclaimed the Persian with a contented
laugh. "How should I not know it? Every
grain of sand in that desert ... every roadside well....
Artaban knows the meaning of the birds' song,
hears the grass growing, and the waters flowing under
the earth. He will run before thine army, nosing the
scent, tracing the road. Believe me, in twenty days
all Persia, as far as the Indies and the ocean, shall be
thine!"
</p><p>
The heart of the Emperor began beating violently.
</p><p>
"Can this be the miracle I was waiting for?"
he mused. "In twenty days, Persia shall be
mine!"
</p><p>
He could scarcely breathe at the thought.
</p><p>
The monster, kneeling before him, murmured.
</p><p>
"Hound me not away from thee! Like a hound
shall I remain lying crouched at thy feet! From the
moment I saw thee, I loved thee, Lord of the Universe,
because thou art the proudest of men! Oh, that thou
wouldst walk over my body, that thou wouldst trample
on me, and I would lick the dust from thy feet, chanting:
'Glory, glory to the son of the Sun, to the king
of the East and of the West, Julian!"
</p><p>
He kissed the Emperor's feet; and the two slaves
prostrating themselves also, repeated after him, "Glory,
glory, glory!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
</p><p>
"But what to do with the ships?" thought Julian
aloud to himself. "Leave them unarmed in the hands
of the enemy or keep them?"
</p><p>
"Burn them," breathed Artaban.
</p><p>
The words thrilled Julian, who looked strangely at
the Persian.
</p><p>
"Burn them? What sayest thou?"
</p><p>
Artaban raised his head and looked steadfastly into
the Emperor's eyes.
</p><p>
"Hast thou <i>fear</i>? Thou!... No, no. Men
alone are fearful, but not the gods! Burn the ships,
and thou shalt be free as the wind. Thy ships shall
not fall into the power of the enemy and thine army be
swelled by the soldiers that work the fleet. Be great
and bold to the very end! Burn them, and in ten days
thou shalt be under the walls of Ecbatana. In twenty
days all Persia shall be thine! Thou shall be greater
than the son of Philip, who conquered Darius. Only
... burn thy ships and follow me!..."
</p><p>
"And if these are but lies&mdash;if I can read in your
heart that you are lying!" exclaimed the Emperor
seizing the Persian with one hand by the throat and
with the other menacing him with a dagger.
</p><p>
Hormizdas uttered a sigh of relief.
</p><p>
For some instants Artaban sustained the gaze of the
Roman without speaking, and Julian again felt the
fascination of those eyes, so intelligent, audacious, and
servile.
</p><p>
"If thou dost not believe me, let me die by thy
hand," repeated the Persian.
</p><p>
Julian relaxed his hold, and returned the poignard
to its sheath.
</p><p>
"It is terrible and pleasant to look thee in the eyes,"
continued Artaban. "Thy visage is that of a god!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
That, as yet no one knows; I alone know that thou
art.... Do not repulse thy slave, sire."
</p><p>
"We shall see," murmured Julian thoughtfully.
"Long have I desired to fight your king, in the
desert.... But the ships...."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes, the ships!" murmured Artaban. "Thou
must set out at once ... this night ... so that the
inhabitants of Ctesiphon cannot see us.... Thou
must burn them...."
</p><p>
Julian did not answer.
</p><p>
"Take them away," he said, pointing out the deserters
to his legionaries. "Keep them under close
watch!"
</p><p>
And returning to his tent, he halted and raised his
eyes&mdash;
</p><p>
"Is this true? So quickly and so simply! I feel
that my will is the will of the gods. I have but to
think, and it is accomplished."
</p><p>
The joyfulness in his heart became intenser. Smiling,
he pressed his hand on his breast to suppress its
tumultuous beating. He still was conscious of shiverings,
and his head felt leaden, as if he had passed the
day in too fierce a sun.
</p><p>
Ordering Victor, an old general blindly devoted to
him, to come to his tent, he confided to him the golden
ring bearing the Imperial seal.
</p><p>
"To the commanders of the fleet, Constantius and
Lucilian," Julian ordered laconically. "Before day-break
they must burn the ships, except the five largest
freighted with bread, and the twelve smaller ones which
serve as pontoon bridges. Burn all the rest. Anybody
opposing this order will answer for it with his
head. Keep the most absolute secrecy.... Go!"
</p><p>
He gave him a piece of papyrus on which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
written a curt order to the commander of the fleet. Victor,
as usual, astonished at nothing, kissed the hem of
the Imperial purple, and went out. Julian then, in spite
of the late hour, convoked a council of war. The generals
met in his tent, moody, suspicious, and secretly
irritated. In a few words Julian explained his plan of
going northwards to the centre of Persia, and then
eastwards towards Ecbatana, to seize the king unawares.
All revolted against the idea, raising their
voices simultaneously, and not hiding the fact that
Julian's plan seemed to them sheer madness. Fatigue,
lack of confidence, and spite were expressed on the faces
of the oldest and wisest soldiers. Several spoke curtly&mdash;all
in opposition.
</p><p>
Sallustius Secundus said, "Whither are we going?
What more do we want? Think, Cæsar: we have
conquered half Persia. Sapor offers better conditions of
peace than ever Asian monarch before has offered to any
Roman conqueror, even to the great Pompeius, Septimius
Severus, or Trajan. Let us, then, conclude peace
before it is too late, and win back to our own country!"
</p><p>
"The soldiers are grumbling," observed Dagalaïf.
"Don't push them to despair; they're worn out; the
number of wounded and sick is great. If you lead
them farther into an unknown desert, we can answer
for nothing. Have mercy on them!... And are
not you yourself in need of rest? You must be more
tired than any of us."
</p><p>
"Let us turn back!" cried all the generals. "To
go on would be madness."
</p><p>
At that moment a dull, menacing sound broke out
behind the tent, a sound like the rumbling of a furious
sea. Julian leant ear, and immediately understood.
It meant mutiny.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
</p><p>
"You know my will," he said coldly to the chiefs,
motioning them to the door. "It is unshakable. In
two hours we must be upon the march. See that all is
ready."
</p><p>
"Well-beloved Augustus," answered Sallustius,
with respectful self-possession, "I will not leave this
tent without telling you what I ought to tell you. You
have spoken with us, your equals not in power but in
valour, in a manner unworthy of a Roman pupil of
Socrates and Plato. We can only pardon your words
by setting them down to a momentary weakness of the
nerves, which clouds your Imperial understanding."
</p><p>
"Is that so?" exclaimed Julian, sarcastically, growing
pale with stifled anger. "Then, my friends, it is
the worse for you, for you are now in the hands of a
madman! I have just given the order to burn the
ships, and my orders are at this moment being carried
out! I foresaw your sage counsel, and have cut off
your means of retreat. Now your lives are in my
hands, and I shall oblige you to believe in miracles!"
</p><p>
All stood overwhelmed; Sallustius alone pushed
towards Cæsar, and taking his hands cried&mdash;
</p><p>
"It is impossible, Cæsar ... surely ... you have
not ... actually...."
</p><p>
He broke off the sentence, and dropped the hands
of the Emperor.
</p><p>
All the company stood up, listening.
</p><p>
The cries of the legionaries became louder and
louder&mdash;the noise of mutiny came nearer, like the
sound of tempest over immense forests.
</p><p>
"Let them shout," said Julian calmly. "Poor
children! Whither will they go without me? You
understand? That is why I burn the ships, the last
hope of the cowardly and the idle. There is now no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
possible return, except by miracle. Now are you
bound to me for life and death. In twenty days Asia
will be ours. I have girt you with terror, that you
may conquer all and become like me. Rejoice! Like
Dionysus, I will lead you through the world, and you
shall be the masters of men and gods!..."
</p><p>
Hardly had he pronounced these words when a cry
of infinite despair resounded through the host&mdash;
</p><p>
"They are on fire!... they are burning!"
</p><p>
The generals rushed out of the tent, followed by
Julian.
</p><p>
They saw the glow of conflagration. Victor had
transmitted the Emperor's orders literally, and Julian
himself watched the flaming spectacle with a smile.
</p><p>
"Cæsar!... May the gods protect us!... He
has escaped!"
</p><p>
With these words, a centurion fell at Julian's feet,
pale and trembling.
</p><p>
"Who has escaped? What mean you?"
</p><p>
"Artaban!... Artaban!... Woe be on us!
Cæsar, he has deceived thee!"
</p><p>
"Impossible!... And the slaves?" stammered
the Emperor, overwhelmed.
</p><p>
"Have just confessed under torture that Artaban
was not a satrap, but a tax-collector of Ctesiphon. He
invented this device to save the city, and lead you
into the desert to deliver you to the Persians. He
knew that you would burn the ships. They also
said that Sapor was advancing at the head of a great
army."
</p><p>
The Emperor rushed to the river-bank to find
Victor&mdash;
</p><p>
"Put out the fires!&mdash;quench them quickly as possible!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
</p><p>
But his voice failed. Staring at the huge blaze
Julian perceived that no human force could conquer the
flames, which were augmented by a violent wind.
</p><p>
He held his head in his hands, and although with no
faith nor prayer in his heart, raised his eyes to heaven,
as if there seeking succour. The stars were shining
above, faint, almost invisible.
</p><p>
The mutiny rolled on, becoming more and more
menacing.
</p><p>
"The Persians have burned the ships!" groaned
some, stretching their arms toward the river.
</p><p>
"No, no, it was the generals, to drag us still farther
into the desert and leave us there," others cried incoherently.
</p><p>
"Kill the priests!" yelled some. "The Etruscans
have poisoned Cæsar, and sent him mad!"
</p><p>
"Glory to Augustus Julian, the conqueror!"
shouted the faithful Gauls and Celts. "Silence,
traitors! so long as Cæsar breathes we have nothing
to fear!"
</p><p>
The cowardly were weeping&mdash;
</p><p>
"Our country! Our country! We won't go a step
farther. We would sooner die. Ah, we shall sooner
see our own ears, than see our own land again! We
are lost, comrades! The Persians have us in a trap!"
</p><p>
"Do you see clearly now?" said the exultant Galileans.
"He is possessed of demons. Julian has sold
his soul, and they're dragging him to the abyss. Are
we going to let a demoniac lead us?"
</p><p>
And nevertheless Julian, seeing nothing, hearing
nothing, murmured as in a dream&mdash;
</p><p>
"What matters it? The miracle will be accomplished!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">VII</h2>

<p>It was the sixteenth of June, and the first bivouac on
the night of the retreat. The army had refused to
go farther. Neither prayers, commands, nor threats
of the Emperor had brought them to reason. Celts,
Romans, Pagans, Christians, brave men and cowards,
all had answered in the same words&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let us go back to our own country!"
</p><p>
The chiefs rejoiced in secret; the Tuscan augurs
openly triumphed. After the burning of the ships
there had been a general insurrection. And now not
only the Galileans but the Olympians and Hellenists
were persuaded that a curse was on the Emperor's
head, and that the Furies were pursuing him. When
he walked through the camp talk would cease and
people edge away from him in fear. Sibylline books
and the Book of Revelation, Tuscan wizards, Christian
prophecies, gods, and angels, joined forces to crush the
common foe. The Emperor then announced that he
would lead his men homewards northward through the
fertile provinces of Apolloniatis and Adiabene. According
to this plan of retreat, while retaining a hope
of forming a junction with the troops of Procopius and
Sebastian, Julian consoled himself with the thought
that he was keeping within the borders of Persia, and
that he might still encounter Sapor's army, deliver
battle, and win a decisive victory.
</p><p>
The Persians were no longer visible. Desiring to
weaken the Romans before a crushing attack, they set
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
on fire their own rich champaigns of barley and wheat,
and destroyed every store and granary in the country.
</p><p>
Julian's soldiers marched through a black desert,
still smoking with traces of fire.
</p><p>
Famine soon set in.
</p><p>
In order to augment the invaders' distress the Persians
had broken the canal-dykes and flooded the fields,
being aided in this endeavour by brooks and torrents
which had overflowed their courses owing to the melting
of the snow on the Armenian mountains. The
flood dried up quickly under the burning rays of the
June sun, but left the warm soil coated with slimy mud.
Asphyxiating vapours and the bitter odour of ashes
and of rotting vegetation loaded the air every night,
and befouled the drinking water, the food, and even
the rags of the soldiers. Myriads of insects rose from
corrupted marshes. Mosquitoes, venomous horse-flies,
rose in clouds round the beasts of burden and fastened
themselves on the men. Their subtle hum went on
night and day. Maddened by stings, the horses died
or stampeded, the oxen broke their traces and overturned
the wagons. After exhausting marches
through defiles and fords the soldiers obtained no rest;
tents were no refuge against the insects, and to get any
sleep the men had to wrap their heads in stifling cloaks,
while the bites of a certain small transparent dung-coloured
fly produced swellings and boils which gradually
became a horrible purulent plague. During the last days
of the march the sun was invisible. The low, dense,
stifling sky was a white cloth of cloud; and its motionless
glare still more painful to the eyes than the naked sun.
</p><p>
And so they kept marching, wasted, weak, with
hung head and feeble step, day after day, between the
implacable sky and the black, burnt earth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
</p><p>
"Surely," they thought, "Anti-Christ, the man
apostate from God, must have intentionally led them
into this accursed place, to leave them to their doom."
Some murmured, "Curse the generals!" but incoherently,
as in a dream. Others kept praying and whining
like sick children, begging a crust of bread or a
mouthful of wine from their companions. Many from
weakness dropped and died on the road.
</p><p>
The Emperor ordered the last rations kept for himself
and for his staff to be distributed among the famished
rank and file. He contented himself with a
thin soup of flour and suet, a fare from which the
meanest soldier would have revolted. Thanks to extreme
temperance, he felt continually full of nervous
excitement, and at the same time a lightness of body,
as if he had wings. This lightness sustained him and
increased his strength tenfold. He attempted not to
think of the future. But to return to Antioch or Tarsus,
defeated, and to submit to Galilean ridicule, that
he certainly would never endure.
</p><p>
One night the soldiers were resting, the north wind
having driven off the flies. Oil, flour, and wine, from
the last Imperial supply, had assuaged their hunger.
The hope of return gradually revived. The camp became
silent. Julian withdrew to his tent. Now he
was wont almost to dispense with sleep, or if he slept
at all, it was towards daybreak. If by chance profound
slumber overtook him, he would wake terrified, with
drops of cold sweat on his forehead. He had need of
full possession of consciousness to stifle the dull pain
gnawing at his soul.
</p><p>
Entering his tent, he trimmed the lamp with a pair
of snuffers. Rolls of parchment and the Gospels lay
around him on the ground in disorder. He began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
write his favourite work, <i>Against the Christians</i>, begun
two months previously at the opening of the campaign.
Reclining, with his back turned to the tent door, Julian
was re-reading the manuscript, when suddenly he
heard a slight noise.
</p><p>
He turned round, uttered a cry, and sprang to his
feet. He thought he saw a ghost. On the threshold
stood a youth, clothed in a ragged brown garment
of camel's hair; a dusty sheepskin, the "melotes" of
the Egyptian anchorites, flung over his shoulders.
His bare feet were shod in sandals of palmwood.
</p><p>
The Emperor scanned him, waiting, unable to pronounce
a word.
</p><p>
"Do you remember," said a well-known voice.
"Do you remember, Julian, how you came to me in
the convent? Then I repulsed you. But I have not
been able to forget you, because we are singularly like
each other, singularly near each other...."
</p><p>
The lad threw back his black hood, Julian saw the
bright brown hair, and recognised Arsinoë.
</p><p>
"Whence&mdash;why have you come? Why are you clad
thus?"
</p><p>
He still feared lest this might be some spirit, which
would vanish as unexpectedly as it had appeared.
</p><p>
In a few words Arsinoë narrated to him her fortunes
since their last parting.
</p><p>
After leaving her guardian Hortensius and giving
the greater part of her wealth to the poor, she had long
lodged with the anchorites to the south of Lake Mareotis,
west of the Nile, among the sterile mountains of
Libya, in the terrible Nitrian and Sciathian deserts.
She had been accompanied by the young Juventinus,
the disciple of old Didimus. They had been taught
daily by the ascetics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
</p><p>
"And then," asked Julian, not without a certain
apprehension, "and then, girl, did you find among
them what you were seeking for?"
</p><p>
She shook her head, and said sadly&mdash;
</p><p>
"No. Flashes of light, allusions, hints, as always,
elsewhere."
</p><p>
"Speak on! Tell me all," implored the Emperor,
his eyes brilliant with hope and gratitude.
</p><p>
"How can I?" she answered slowly. "For, my
friend, I was seeking the freedom of the soul; but it
has no existence here!"
</p><p>
"Yes, yes! is not that true?" cried Julian, exultant.
"That was what I told you, Arsinoë."
</p><p>
She seated herself on a stool covered with a leopardskin,
and continued her tale calmly, with the same sad
smile, Julian listening in an avidity of joy....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Tell me, how did you leave those unhappy desert-folk?"
demanded Julian.
</p><p>
"I was tempted once," replied Arsinoë; "once in
the desert among the rocks I found a fragment of white
marble. I picked it up and long wondered at it,
sparkling in the sun, and suddenly I remembered
Athens, my youth, my art, and you! I awoke, and I
decided to return to the world, to live and die as God
had created me; as an artist. At that moment the old
Didimus had a vision in which I was the means of reconciling
you with the Galilean...."
</p><p>
"With the Galilean!" ejaculated the Emperor.
</p><p>
His face darkened, his eyes lost their fire, the
triumphant laugh died on his lips.
</p><p>
"Curiosity, too, drew me again towards you," continued
Arsinoë. "I wished to know if you had attained
truth in the way you pursued, and what summit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
you had reached. I resumed the habit of a monk.
Brother Juventinus and I descended the Nile as far as
Alexandria; then a ship took us to Antioch; and we
have journeyed with a great Syrian caravan through
Apamea, Epiphania, and Edessa to the frontier. After
a thousand dangers, we crossed the Mesopotamian
desert, abandoned by the Persians, and not far from
the village of Abuzat, after the victory at Ctesiphon,
we saw your camp. And so I am here!... And
you, Julian?"
</p><p>
He sighed, and hung his head without answering.
Then scanning her, he demanded&mdash;
</p><p>
"And now you too detest Him, Arsinoë?"
</p><p>
"No; why?" she answered simply. "Why detest
Him? Did not the sages of Hellas come near, in their
teaching, to the message of the Galilean? Those who
in the desert martyrise soul and body are far from the
humble Son of Mary. He used to love children, freedom,
cheerfulness, and the fair white lilies of the field.
He loved beauty, Julian!... We have wandered
from Him and become entangled and embittered. All
call you the Apostate, ... but it is they who are the
apostates...."
</p><p>
The Emperor knelt down before Arsinoë and raised
upon her eyes full of prayer; tears coursed slowly down
his lean cheeks.
</p><p>
"It must not be," he murmured. "Do not speak.
Why? Why? Let be what has been!... Do not
again become mine enemy!"
</p><p>
"No, no! I must say it all to you," exclaimed
Arsinoë. "Listen! I know that you love Him!
It is so, and that is the fatality upon you. Against
whom have you revolted? What kind of enemy are
you for Him? When your lips are cursing the Crucified,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
your heart is aspiring after Him. When you are
struggling against His name, you are closer to Him,
closer to His spirit, than those who repeat with dead
lips, 'Lord, Lord'!... And it is they who are your
enemies, and not He. Ah! why do you torture yourself
more than the Galilean monks?"
</p><p>
The Emperor tore himself from the clasp of Arsinoë,
and stood up, pale as one dead. His face again grew
restless, and in his eyes shone the old hatred. He
muttered with sorrowful irony&mdash;
</p><p>
"Away with you! Go from me! I know the devices
of the Galileans!"
</p><p>
Arsinoë gazed at him in fear and despair, as at one
insane&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian!... Julian, what is the matter? Is it
possible that a mere name...."
</p><p>
But he had regained cold self-possession. His eyes
were lustreless, his air indifferent, almost contemptuous;
the Roman Emperor was speaking to a Galilean.
</p><p>
"Depart, Arsinoë. Forget all that I have said. It
was a moment of weakness which is over. I am tranquil.
You see, we must remain strangers. The
shadow of the Crucified is always between us. You
have not renounced Him, and he who is not His enemy
cannot be my friend...."
</p><p>
She fell on her knees before him&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why? why? What are you doing? Have pity
on me; have pity on yourself, before it is too late!
For this is madness. Return, or you must...."
</p><p>
She paused, and he completed the sentence for her
with a haughty smile&mdash;
</p><p>
"Or I must perish, you mean, Arsinoë? Be it so.
I shall follow my road to the end, lead where it may!
If, as you say, I have been unjust toward the wisdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
of the Galileans, remember what I have borne at their
hands. How numberless, how despicable were my
enemies!... The other day some Roman soldiers
found before my eyes, in a Mesopotamian marsh, a
lion tortured by flies. They had buried themselves in
his throat, in his ears, in his nostrils, choking his
breath, sealing his eyes, and in their stinging myriads
had mastered even his powers at last! Such shall my
death be, and such the victory of the Galileans over
Cæsar!"
</p><p>
The girl still held out towards him her pale hands;
but without a word, without a hope, like a friend
towards a friend who is dead. Between the two lay
still that abyss which is not to be crossed by the living.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Towards the twentieth of July the Roman army,
after a long journey across burnt plains, found a little
grass which had escaped from the devastators in the
deep valley of the river Durous.
</p><p>
A field of ripe wheat was found hard by. The
soldiers reaped it and rested in the valley three days.
Unspeakably happy, the legionaries threw themselves
down on the verdure, breathing the delightful moisture
of the earth, and brushing the cool blades of grass
against their dusty faces.
</p><p>
On the morning of the fourth day the Roman sentinels
perceived a cloud of smoke or dust. Some supposed
it to be the wild asses, which usually roamed in
herds for safety against the attack of lions. Others
affirmed that it was Saracens, attracted by the news
of the siege of Ctesiphon. A few expressed their fears
lest it should prove to be the principal army of King
Sapor.
</p><p>
The Emperor ordered the call to arms to be sounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
on the bugles. The cohorts in strict defensive order,
sheltered by their locked shields, as by walls of metal,
formed a camp half-circlewise on the river bank. The
cloud of smoke or dust remained on the horizon until
evening, nor could any divine with certainty what
lurked behind it. The night was dark and still, with
not a star in the sky.
</p><p>
The Romans did not sleep. They stood round huge
bivouac-fires in mute restlessness, awaiting the dawn.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XVIII</h2>

<p>
At sunrise they saw the Persians. The enemy was
advancing slowly. Experienced soldiers estimated
their number at nearly two hundred thousand.
Hill after hill unmasked new bodies of men, and the
glittering of the arms on these detachments, in spite of
distance and dust, was almost dazzlingly bright. The
Romans, with hardly a word in the ranks, left the valley
of the previous night and ranged themselves in battle-order.
Their faces were stern, but not sad. Danger
now stifled their hatred, and all looks were fixed upon
the Emperor, Christians as well as Pagans seeking to
surmise from his expression whether they might still
hope for success.
</p><p>
At that hour Julian was beaming with joy. Long,
long, had he awaited this encounter with the Persians,
awaited the miracle in which victory would give him
such renown and power that the Galileans could no
longer resist. He was haughty as one of the old heroes
of Hellas. Danger seemed to spiritualise him;
and a gay and terrible light was in his eyes.
</p><p>
The heavy and dusty morning of the twenty-second
of July seemed the prelude to a day of burning
heat, and the Emperor objected to wear a breastplate,
and remained clad in a light silken tunic. Victor,
the general, came up holding a coat-of-mail, and
said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Cæsar, I have had a bad dream; tempt not fate;
wear armour!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
</p><p>
Julian silently waved his hand in negation. The
old man fell on his knees&mdash;
</p><p>
"Put it on! Have pity on your slave!... This
battle will be perilous...."
</p><p>
Julian took a shield, flung the light purple of his
chlamys over his shoulder, and vaulting on horseback
said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Let me be, old friend! I need nothing."
</p><p>
He vanished, his golden-crested helm glittering for
a while in the sun, while Victor anxiously followed
him with his eyes.
</p><p>
Julian disposed his army in a peculiar form, like a
crescent. The enormous half-circle was to bury its
two points in the Persian mass and squeeze it inwards
from two sides. The right wing was commanded by
Dagalaïf, the left by Hormizdas, Julian and Victor
leading the centre. The trumpets sounded. The earth
trembled under the soft and heavy tread of the Persian
elephants, wearing huge plumes of ostrich-feathers on
their foreheads. Turrets of hide were lashed on the
back of the beasts by thick thongs; and each turret held
four archers, who shot flaming arrows of tow and pitch.
</p><p>
The Roman horse did not stand the first shock.
With deafening roars and raised trunks the elephants
opened their huge moist gullets. The legionaries felt in
their faces the hot wind of the monsters, maddened before
battle by a special drink made of wine, pepper,
and spices. With foot spikes painted in vermilion and
tipped with steel, the elephants disembowelled horses,
and their trunks whirled horsemen from the saddle and
dashed them against the ground. The torrid heat of
the afternoon raised from the trumpeting beasts a rank
odour of sweat which made the horses wince, rear, and
tremble violently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
</p><p>
One cohort had already taken flight. It happened to
be a body of Christians. Julian pursued them, and striking
the chief decurion full in the face, cried furiously&mdash;
</p><p>
"Cowards! I suppose praying is the only thing you
are good for?"
</p><p>
The light Thracian archery and Paphlagonian skirmishers
now advanced against the elephants. Behind
them marched Illyrians, skilful throwers of the leaded
javelins, the "Martiobarbuli." Julian gave the order
to aim arrows, stones, and javelins at the legs of the
elephants. An arrow struck an enormous Indian beast
in the eye. He trumpeted and reared, the girths
snapped, saddle and leather turret slid and upset,
shedding the Persian archers like birds from a nest.
Confusion followed among the huge pachyderms.
Wounded in the legs they staggered and fell, and their
squadron became little more than a mountain of grey
masses. Their feet in air, their trunks bleeding, their
armour smashed, they lay amid ruins of the turrets, half
crushed horses, and piles of Roman and Persian dead.
</p><p>
At last the elephants took flight, and rushed headlong
against the Persians, trampling them underfoot.
This particular danger had been foreseen by the barbarian
tacticians. The previous instance of the battle
under Nizibis had shown that an army may be defeated
by its own allies. Now the mahouts began to slash
the monsters with curved cutlasses between the two
joints of the spine lying nearest the skull; a single
blow in this exact spot sufficing to kill outright the
largest and strongest of the great beasts. The cohorts
of Martiobarbuli charged, clambering over the
wounded and pursuing those in flight.
</p><p>
At this instant Julian galloped to support the left
wing. On that side rode the Persian <i>Clibanarii</i>, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
famous body of cavalry, bound man to man by a strong
chain, and clad in invulnerable scale-armour. They
received the waves of battle like a row of bronze equestrian
statues. They could only be wounded through
narrow slits left for mouth and eyes.
</p><p>
Against the Clibaniars Julian sent his old faithful
friends, the Batavians and the Celts. They would die
for a smile from Cæsar, gazing at him with eyes of
childlike adoration. The right wing of the Romans
was assailed by Persian chariots, drawn by galloping
zebras. Scythes were affixed to their axles, which,
sweeping along with incredible swiftness, mowed legs
from horses and heads from soldiers, and lopped bodies
in half, easily as the reaper's sickle takes the corn.
</p><p>
Towards the end of the day, weighed down in their
overheated armour, the Clibaniars wavered. Julian
massed all his forces against them. They broke, and
re-formed, but their ranks at last became confused and
fled. A cry of triumph broke from the Emperor's lips.
He galloped ahead, pursuing the fugitives, not perceiving
that he was far in advance of his main body.
A few body-guards surrounded the Cæsar, amongst
them old General Victor. This old man, though
wounded in the hand, was unconscious of his hurt, not
quitting the Emperor's side for a moment, and shielding
him time after time from mortal blows. He knew
that it was as dangerous to approach a fleeing army as
to enter a falling building.
</p><p>
"Take heed, Cæsar!" he shouted. "Put on this
mail of mine!" but Julian heard him not, and still
rode on, on&mdash;his breast lying bared to drink in the
wind&mdash;as if he, unsupported, unarmed, and terrible,
was hunting his countless enemies by glance and gesture
only from the field. Laughter was on his lips;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
through the cloud of dust, raised by the furious gallop
of the horse, shone the B&oelig;otian helmet, and the outspread
folds of his chlamys streamed into two great
wings of purple, that seemed to bear him farther and
yet farther.
</p><p>
In front, a small detachment of Saracens was in flight.
One of these horsemen, turning in his saddle, recognised
Julian by his raiment, and pointing him out to his
comrades, uttered a guttural cry like that of an eagle&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Malek, malek!</i> ... The king, the king!"
</p><p>
All wheeled round, and at full gallop sprang upright,
standing on their saddles, their long white vestments
streaming, and lances poised above their heads. The
Emperor saw the bronzed face of a young robber, one
little more than a lad. Riding rapidly towards him on
a Bactrian dromedary, from whose shaggy hair lumps
of dry mud swung and dangled, Victor parried two
lances aimed at the Emperor by Bedouins. Then the
lad on the camel aimed, his fierce look glittering and
white teeth showing while he cried gleefully&mdash;
</p><p>
"<i>Malek, malek!</i>"
</p><p>
"That boy is happy," was the thought that flashed
through Julian's mind, "and I too...."
</p><p>
He had no time to finish; the lance hissed, and grazing
the skin of his right hand, glanced over the ribs
and buried itself below the liver. Julian thought the
wound a slight one, and seizing the double-edged barb
to withdraw it, cut his fingers. Blood gushed out.
Julian uttered a cry, flung his head back, fixed his
staring eyes on the pale sky, and slid from his horse
into the arms of the guard.
</p><p>
Victor supported him with tender veneration, gazing
with trembling lips at the closed eyes of his sovereign.
The tardy cohorts in the rear came up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XIX</h2>

<p>The Emperor was carried into his tent, and laid on
his camp-bed. Still in a swoon, he groaned from
time to time. Oribazius, the physician, drew out the
iron lance-head, and washed and bound up the deep
wound. By a look Victor asked if any hope remained,
and Oribazius sadly shook his head. After the dressing
of the wound Julian sighed and opened his
eyes.
</p><p>
"Where am I?" he asked in surprise with a glance
round. Then hearing the distant noise of battle he remembered
all, and with an effort rose upon his bed.
</p><p>
"Why have they brought me here? Where is my
horse? Quick, Victor!"
</p><p>
Suddenly his face writhed with pain, friends hastened
to support him, but he thrust back Victor and
Oribazius.
</p><p>
"Permit me! I must be with them to the end."
</p><p>
His soul was struggling against death. Slowly,
with infinite difficulty, he tottered to his feet, a faint
smile playing on his lips, and the old fire in his eyes.
</p><p>
"You see, I am able-bodied still ... quick! give
me my sword, buckler, horse!"
</p><p>
Victor gave him the shield and sword. Julian took
them and made a few unsteady steps, like a child learning
to walk. The wound re-opened; he let fall his
arms, sank into the arms of Oribazius and Victor and
looking up cried contemptuously&mdash;
</p><p>
"All is over! Thou hast conquered, Galilean!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
</p><p>
And making no further resistance, he gave himself
up to his friends, and was laid on the bed.
</p><p>
"Yes, yes," he repeated softly, "I am dying."
</p><p>
Oribazius leaned towards him, consoling him, assuring
him that the wound would heal.
</p><p>
"Why deceive me?" answered Julian; "I am not
afraid...." Then he added gravely, "I hope I shall
die the death of the righteous."
</p><p>
In the evening he lost consciousness. Hour after
hour went by. The sun went down. Fighting
ceased. A lamp was lighted in the tent, and night
slowly descended.
</p><p>
Julian did not recover consciousness. His breathing
grew weaker; he was thought to be breathing his last.
But later his eyes opened, little by little; his look was
fixed steadily on a corner of the tent. A rapid whisper
broke from his lips: he was in delirium.
</p><p>
"Thou, here, why?... what matters it? All is
over. Canst Thou not see that?... Go. Thou
hatedst laughter.... And so we can never forgive
Thee...."
</p><p>
Then, regaining his faculties, he asked of Oribazius&mdash;
</p><p>
"What hour is it? Shall I see the sun?"
</p><p>
And he added dreamily&mdash;
</p><p>
"Oribazius, can it be possible that reason should be
really so powerless? I believe it is a weakness of the
body ... blood fills the brain, creating phantoms....
One must conquer ... reason must...."
</p><p>
His ideas anew became confused, and his gaze resumed
its fixity&mdash;
</p><p>
"I will not! Do you hear?... Go, Tempter!
I do not believe! Socrates died like a god. Reason
... Victor, ah, Victor!... what do you want from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
me? Thou, the unappeasable, the implacable? Thy
love is more terrible than death.... Thy burden is
the heaviest of all.... Why dost thou look at me
so? How much I have loved thee, Good Shepherd!
... Only Thou? No, no! The pierced feet, blood?
... The death of Hellas ... darkness?... I
want sunlight, the golden sun ... on the Parthenon
marble!... Wouldst thou veil the sun?..."
</p><p>
It was one o'clock in the morning. The legions had
returned to camp, with no exultation over their victory.
In spite of fatigue, scarcely any slept, all waiting
for news from the Imperial tent. Many stood
sleeping, leaning on their lances round the half-extinguished
camp-fires; and the breathing of picketed horses
could be heard, munching captured forage of corn.
</p><p>
Between the dark rows of tents, faint white lines
showed on the horizon. Stars became yet more chilly
and pale. The mists kept spreading, and the steel of
lances and shields was clouded with dew. Here and
there crew a cock, belonging to the Tuscan soothsayers.
A calm sadness hovered over heaven and
earth. The scene was illusive as a mirror; the near
seemed far off and the distant came near.
</p><p>
At the entrance to Julian's tent stood a throng of
generals, friends, and familiar companions, all looking
like phantoms in the misty twilight. Still deeper silence
reigned within the tent. Oribazius, the physician,
was pounding simples in a mortar to make a refreshing
drink. The sick man lay calm, and the delirium
had left him. At dawn, collecting himself, he asked
impatiently&mdash;
</p><p>
"When will the sun rise?"
</p><p>
"In an hour," answered Oribazius glancing at the
clepsydra.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
</p><p>
"Call the generals," ordered Julian. "I must
speak...."
</p><p>
"Well-beloved Cæsar, it may be hurtful...."
</p><p>
"What matter! I shall not die before the sun rises.
Victor, raise my head."
</p><p>
He was told about the victory over the Persians, the
flight of the enemy's cavalry, and of the two sons of
Sapor the king; of the death of fifty satraps. Julian
showed neither astonishment nor gladness. He remained
indifferent.
</p><p>
Dagalaïf, Hormizdas, Ariphas, Lucilian, and Sallustius
came in, headed by the general Jovian. Many,
with an eye to the future, had wished to see on the
throne this weak and timid man, who could be dangerous
to none. It was their hope under his rule to recover
from the anxieties of the tumultuous reign of
Julian. Jovian possessed the art of pleasing all. Tall
and handsome in person, he in no way differed from
the crowd, aiming at all-round benevolence. Among
the intimate friends stood also a young centurion of the
Imperial horse, the future famous historian, Ammianus
Marcellinus. Everyone was aware that he was writing
an account of the campaign, and amassing documents
for a great historical work. Stooping under the tent-door
Ammianus drew out tablets and stylus. A keen
and impartial curiosity animated his stern face; and
with the coolness of an artist or a man of science he prepared
to take notes of the speech of the dying Emperor.
</p><p>
"Lift the curtain!" Julian ordered.
</p><p>
It was raised, and everyone stood aside so that the
fresh air of the morning might blow on the face of the
dying. The door faced east, and the view to the horizon
was unbroken.
</p><p>
"Now put the lamp out."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
</p><p>
The order was executed, and the tent filled with
twilight. Everybody stood waiting in silence.
</p><p>
"Listen, friends," Julian began; his voice was low
but clear, his whole presence breathed a triumph of
mind over body, and invincible will still gleamed from
those eyes. The hand of Ammianus trembled, but he
wrote down the words uttered. He knew that he was
writing on the tables of history, and transmitting to
men unborn the last words of a great man.
</p><p>
"Listen, friends; my hour is come, perhaps too soon.
But you see, like an honest debtor, I am not sorry to
give back my life to Nature, and in my soul is neither
pain nor fear; nothing but cheerfulness, and a fore-feeling
of the long repose. I have simply done my
duty, and have nothing to repent of. From the days
when I daily expected death, like a hunted beast, in
the palace of Macellum, in Cappadocia, up to the day
of greatness when I took on the purple of the Roman
Cæsar, I have tried to keep my soul stainless, I have
aspired to ends not ignoble. If I have failed&mdash;and I
have failed&mdash;to do all that I desired, you will not forget
that most of our earthly affairs are in the hands of
Destiny. And now I thank the Eternal for having
allowed me to die neither after long sickness nor at the
hands of the executioner, but on the battlefield&mdash;in
mid-youth&mdash;in mid-endeavour, half-way to achievement....
And dear, dear friends...."
</p><p>
His voice ceased; everyone present knelt down;
many were weeping.
</p><p>
"No, no, my dear friends," said Julian smiling;
"why weep for those who are going back to their own
country? Take heart, Victor!"
</p><p>
The old man tried to answer, but in vain; then hiding
his face in his hands, he sobbed aloud.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
</p><p>
"Soft! Soft!" cried Julian; and then turning
toward the sky: "Ah, there He is!"
</p><p>
The morning clouds were growing rosy, and the twilight
in the tent had become warm and mellow; the
first beam of the sun washed over the rim of the horizon.
The dying man held his face towards the light,
with closed eyes.
</p><p>
Then Sallustius Secundus went up to Julian and
kissing his hand said&mdash;
</p><p>
"Well-beloved Augustus! whom do you name as
your successor?"
</p><p>
"What matters it? Let Destiny decide! We must
not resist her. Let the Galileans triumph. We shall
conquer later on. And then shall begin on earth the
reign of the equals of the gods, souls laughing for ever
like the sun.... Look, behold him!"
</p><p>
A faint shiver ran through his body, and with a last
effort Julian stretched out his arms, as if he would have
rushed to meet the rising orb. Blood gushed from his
wound, and the veins swelled on neck and temples.
</p><p>
"Water! water!" he whispered, choking.
</p><p>
Victor lifted a golden cup of spring-water to his
mouth. Julian, looking forth from the tent drank
thirstily of the ice-cold draught. Then his head fell
back, and the last murmur came from his half-open
lips&mdash;
</p><p>
"Helios! receive me into thyself...."

The eyes went out. Victor closed their lids. The
face of the Emperor, lying in the sun-rays, took on a
look of one of the Olympians sleeping.

<h2 class="p2">XX</h2>

<p>Three months had elapsed since the shameful
treaty of peace signed by Jovian with the Persians.
At the beginning of October the Roman army,
exhausted by famine and forced marches through the
deserts of Mesopotamia, had at last reached Antioch.
During this melancholy retreat Anatolius, the centurion
of Imperial cavalry, had formed a close friendship
with the historian, Ammianus Marcellinus. The
two friends had decided to betake themselves to Italy,
to a secluded villa at Baiæ, whither Arsinoë had invited
them, to rest from the fatigues of the campaign,
and to heal their wounds at the sulphur-baths.
</p><p>
On this journey, they had made a halt of some days
at Antioch, where great festivals were in preparation,
in honour of Jovian's accession to the throne and of the
return of the army.
</p><p>
The peace concluded with King Sapor was dishonourable
for the Empire. Five rich Roman provinces
lying along the farther banks of the Tigris, together
with fifteen frontier fortresses, including Singara,
Castra Maurorum, and the invincible Nizibis, all these
passed into the hands of Sapor. Little did the Galileans
care for the defeat of Rome. When the news of
Julian's death arrived at Antioch, the timorous citizens
believed at first that it was some new device of Satan,
fresh toils in which to capture the righteous. But when
the news was confirmed their joy became delirious.
</p><p>
In the early morning the noise of festival and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
cries of the people reached the sleeping-chamber of Anatolius.
He had decided to pass all day indoors, the rejoicing
of the populace being repugnant to him. He
attempted to sleep again, and failed. A strange curiosity
woke in him. Without a word to Ammianus, he
dressed quickly, and went out into the street. It was
a fresh and pleasant autumn morning.
</p><p>
Great round clouds, in sharp contrast with the deep
blue of the sky, sailed over the innumerable colonnades
and marble porticoes of Antioch. In the forum and
the markets everywhere ran the murmur of fountains
and streams; and down the long dusty vistas of the
bright streets flowed wide currents, artificially-channelled
waters, crossing each other in a perfect network
of rills. Here and there pigeons were cooing and
picking grains of barley. The scent of flowers and incense
issued from the open doors of churches. Near
the fountain-basins young girls were sprinkling their
baskets of pale October roses with water, or singing
joyful psalms, and garlanding the columns of the
Christian basilicas. A noisy crowd was pouring
through the streets. Chariots and litters were forging
slowly down the middle of the pavements. At every
moment rose cries of&mdash;
</p><p>
"Hail to Jovian Augustus, the great and happy!"
</p><p>
Some added: "The conqueror," but with a certain
diffidence, as if the word smacked of irony.
</p><p>
The same urchin who had once caricatured Julian on
the walls of the town was there now clapping his hands,
beating his drum, whistling, tumbling in the dust, and
shouting (although he had no notion of the meaning
of the words)&mdash;
</p><p>
"The Wild Boar has perished, the Devastator of the
Garden of Eden!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
</p><p>
An old woman, bent double in her rags, came out
like a black-beetle into the sun, rejoicing with the rest.
She was brandishing a stick and vociferating in a
cracked voice&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian has perished! The evil-doer has perished!"
</p><p>
An infinite sadness filled the heart of Anatolius; but
urged by curiosity he wandered on, and in following
the Syngon, approached the cathedral. There he saw an
official connected with the quæstorship, Marcus Avinius,
coming out of the basilica, accompanied by two slaves,
who elbowed a passage for him through the crowd.
</p><p>
"What is this?" wondered Anatolius. "Why
should this enemy of the Galileans be here?"
</p><p>
Crosses embroidered in gold adorned the violet
chlamys of Avinius, and were even sewn on his crimson
leather shoes.
</p><p>
Julius Mauricus, another friend of Anatolius, accosted
Avinius&mdash;
</p><p>
"How do you do, my reverend friend?" he asked,
after a surprised and mocking scrutiny of the dignitary's
new costume.
</p><p>
Julius was a free man, having an independent fortune;
and for him the change of religion was a matter
of indifference. He was by no means surprised at the
transformation of his official friends, but took pleasure
in putting teasing questions whenever he met them,
assuming the air of a moralist who concealed indignation
under the mask of irony.
</p><p>
The people were hurrying to the entrance of the
church, and upon the deserted steps outside the friends
were soon able to talk freely. Anatolius, ensconced
behind a column, listened to the dialogue&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why didn't you stay to the end of the service?"
asked Mauricus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
</p><p>
"Palpitations. I was half-stifled. I'm not accustomed..."
and Avinius added thoughtfully&mdash;
</p><p>
"The new preacher has an extraordinary style. His
exaggerations act too violently on my nerves. A style
... like the scratching of iron on glass!"
</p><p>
"Really, how touching!" laughed Mauricus.
"Here's a man who has abjured conscience!...
But <i>style</i>...."
</p><p>
"No, no; perhaps I didn't understand him well!"
interrupted Avinius. "Don't disbelieve it! Mauricus,
I am sincere."
</p><p>
From a downy litter the head of the chancery himself,
Garguillus, got out, groaning&mdash;
</p><p>
"I think I'm late.... But that's of no great importance;
I'll remain on the space outside ... God
and the Holy Ghost...."
</p><p>
"Here's another miracle!" laughed Mauricus.
"Texts from the Bible, in the mouth of Garguillus!"
</p><p>
"May Christ forgive you, my son!" quoth that imperturbable
quæstor; "what are you always racking
your soul about?"
</p><p>
"Oh, but up to now I haven't been able quite to get
over it! There are so many conversions, so many
transformations! I had always imagined that your
opinions...."
</p><p>
"Pure stupidity, my dear son! I have only one
opinion, which is, that the Galilean cooks are no worse
than the Hellenist cooks. The Hellenists put me on a
lenten diet ... which would make anybody ill....
Come and dine, O philosopher, and I'll bring you over
to my belief. You will lick your fingers after it!
And, after all, isn't it the same thing to eat a good
dinner in honour of the god Hermes, and to eat
it in honour of St. Mercurius? All these things are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
prejudices. I don't see anything irritating in trifles
like this." And he pointed to the little amber
cross, which dangled amidst the perfumed folds of
an amethystine-purple robe, upon his enormous
belly.
</p><p>
"Look, there's Hekobolis, the arch-priest of the
goddess Astarte-Dindymene! The hierophant has repented,
and is now in black Galilean vestments again!...
Oh, Ovid, singer of <i>Metamorphoses</i>, why art thou
not here?" chanted Mauricus, pointing to an old man
with a red face seated in a covered litter&mdash;
</p><p>
"What's he reading?"
</p><p>
"It surely can't be the laws of the goddess of Pessinus!"
</p><p>
"What divine humility!... Fasting has thinned
him!... Look how he's sighing and throwing up
his eyes!"
</p><p>
"Do you know the story of his conversion?" asked
Garguillus with a cheerful laugh.
</p><p>
"He went to find Jovian, the Emperor, and I suppose,
as formerly with Julian, fell at his feet...."
</p><p>
"Oh, no! he invented something entirely new.
There was a sudden public repentance. He prostrated
himself at the door of a church, just as Jovian was
coming out, and in the middle of the crowd, Hekobolis
shouted 'Trample on me! trample on me! I am Dead-Sea
fruit!' and, with tears, kissed the feet of the passers-by."
</p><p>
"Ah ... that's new! And was it successful?"
</p><p>
"By Jove! he had a private interview with the Emperor.
Oh, people like him have got nine lives!
Everything turns to gold in their fingers. When they
slough the old skin, they get young again. Learn,
my children...."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
</p><p>
"And what did he manage to say to the Emperor?"
</p><p>
"How can I tell?" sighed Garguillus, not without
a certain secret jealousy. "He may have said perhaps,
'Cling to Christianity till not a Pagan be left
upon earth! The religion of the just is the basis of
your throne!' Now his fortune is made; and far more
securely than in the time of Julian. What exquisite
sagacity!"
</p><p>
"Oh, my benefactors, protect me! Snatch Cicumbrix,
the humblest of your slaves, from the claws of
the lions!"
</p><p>
"What's happened?" asked Garguillus of the consumptive
shoemaker, who was being dragged off by
two of the town police.
</p><p>
"They're going to throw me into prison!"
</p><p>
"Why?"
</p><p>
"For pillaging a church..."
</p><p>
"What? You have..."
</p><p>
"No, no! I was in the crowd, and I just cried out
once or twice 'Beat them!' That was under Augustus
Julian. Then they said, 'Cæsar desires that the
Christian churches shall be destroyed.' But I didn't
go into the church; I stayed outside. My shop is a
wretched little place; but it's on a crowded square,
and if anything happens I'm always lugged up as a
witness. O defend me! Have pity on me!"
</p><p>
"Are you a Christian or a Pagan?" asked Julius.
</p><p>
"I don't know myself. Before Constantine's time I
sacrificed to the gods. Then I was baptised. Then,
under Constantius, I became an Arian. Afterwards I
had to become a Hellenist. Now I want to be an
Arian again; but it's all mixed up in my head! I
obey orders, and I never can happen to profess the true
religion at the right time. I have fought for Christ,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
and also for the gods.... But it's always either too
soon or too late! One gets no rest.... I have children....
Protect me, benefactors!"
</p><p>
"Fear nothing, my friend; we will get you off. I
remember you once made me a handsome pair of
shoes."
</p><p>
Anatolius, unperceived by his friends, now went into
the church, desiring to hear Theodorite, the young and
celebrated preacher. The sun was shining through
clouds of incense, and one of the slanting rays fell on
the red beard of the speaker in the pulpit. His frail
hands were transparent as wax; his exultant eyes
feverishly bright, and his thrilling voice thundered in
an avenging cry.
</p><p>
"I desire to write, as on a sign-post of infamy for
future generations, the history of Julian, the foul renegade.
May all ages and peoples read my inscription,
and tremble before the justice of the Lord!... Come
hither, torturer, serpent of wisdom, to-day we will
scoff at thee! Together, my brothers, let us rejoice;
let us sound our timbrels, and chant the chant of
Miriam over the destruction of the Egyptians in the
Red Sea. O Emperor! where are thy ceremonies, thy
mysteries? Where now are thy invocations and thy
divinations? Where are thy Persian and Babylonish
glories? Where are the gods that accompanied thee&mdash;thy
defenders, Julian? All have deceived thee, all
have vanished!"
</p><p>
"Ah, my dear! What a beard he has!" said an
ancient rouged patrician lady, standing near Anatolius,
to her neighbour. "It's a sort of gold, of brown-gold
colour!"
</p><p>
"Yes, but how about his teeth?" answered the
other.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
</p><p>
"What&mdash;teeth? With a beard like that, teeth are
nothing!"
</p><p>
"No! ah no, Veronica, don't say that! Can one
compare him with brother Tiphanius..."
</p><p>
Theodorite continued&mdash;
</p><p>
"Julian bred evil in his soul as wild beasts secrete
venom. God waited till all his cruelty was manifest,
to strike him...."
</p><p>
"Don't miss the circus to-day," murmured another
neighbour of Anatolius into the ear of his companion.
"There are going to be she-bears from Britain."
</p><p>
"You don't say so! Real ones?"
</p><p>
"Yes. One's called Mica Aurea (grain of gold),
and the other Innocentia! They're fed on human
flesh. And then, there'll be the gladiators!"
</p><p>
"Lord Jesus!... we mustn't miss that! Let's
not wait for the end! Let's run, in order to get a seat
in time!"
</p><p>
Meantime Theodorite was praising Julian's predecessor
for his Christian benevolence, pure life, and love
for all his family.
</p><p>
Anatolius felt choked by the crowd. He went out
of the church, and once quit of the smell of incense
and oil, drew a deep breath of fresh air under the blue
sky.
</p><p>
Outside the church portico a loud conversation was
going on undisturbed. A grave rumour was circulating
in the crowd; the two she-bears were being led
through the streets to the amphitheatre. Those who
heard the news precipitately left the church before the
end of the sermon, asking each other anxiously&mdash;
</p><p>
"Are we still in time? Is Mica Aurea ill?"
</p><p>
"No, it's Innocentia who had a fit of indigestion
to-day. But now she's going on quite well."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
</p><p>
"Thank God ... thank God!"
</p><p>
The church quickly emptied. Anatolius saw panting
multitudes running in the direction of the circus
from every street, from every alley, from every basilica.
They crushed each other, trampled on women
and children, hurled abuse, lost their sandals, but halted
for nothing in the race. Every face wore a careworn
expression denoting that life depended on getting a
seat in the amphitheatre. Two names full of sanguinary
promise passed from lip to lip&mdash;
</p><p>
"Mica Aurea! Innocentia!"
</p><p>
Anatolius followed the crowd into the amphitheatre.
</p><p>
According to the Roman custom a vast awning, the
velarium, sprinkled with perfume, protected the people
against the rays of the sun, and spread a pleasant coolness.
Thousands of heads already swarmed round the
circus.
</p><p>
Before the opening of the games, the highest dignitaries
in Antioch carried the bronze statue of Jovian
into the Imperial box, so that the people could enjoy a
sight of the new sovereign. In his right hand Augustus
was holding a globe surmounted by a cross. The
sun lighted up the placid bronze countenance of the
Emperor. The officials kissed the feet of the statue,
and the populace yelled with joy&mdash;
</p><p>
"Hail to the saviour of the country, Augustus
Jovian!"
</p><p>
Multitudes of hands waved coloured girdles and
linen kerchiefs. The crowd acclaimed in Jovian its
symbol, its soul, its image regnant over the world. In
its scorn of the dead Emperor the mob next addressed
itself to Julian, as if he were there, still alive in the
amphitheatre, and could hear them&mdash;
</p><p>
"Well, philosopher, the wisdom of Plato and Crisipus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
wasn't much good to you! Jupiter and Ph&oelig;bus didn't
protect you! Now you are in the claws of the devils!
Ah, you godless idolater, Christ has conquered! We,
the humble of the world, have conquered!"
</p><p>
All were convinced that Julian had been slain by a
Christian, and returned thanks to God for the blow.
But the furious enthusiasm of the crowd reached its
highest pitch when they saw the gladiator prostrate in
the claws of Mica Aurea. Their eyes started out of
their heads to glut themselves with the sight of blood;
and to the roaring of the wild beast the people responded
by a roar wilder still&mdash;
</p><p>
"Glory to the most pious Emperor Jovian! Christ
has conquered!"
</p><p>
Anatolius felt overcome with disgust at the sweltering
breath and odour of the human horde. Closing his
eyes, attempting not to draw breath, he ran out into
the street, returned to his lodging, closed door and
shutters, and flung himself on his bed until night-fall.
But it was impossible to escape the populace.
</p><p>
Hardly had twilight descended, when the whole of
Antioch was illumined by thousands of lights. At the
angles of basilicas and Imperial edifices huge torches
were aflare, and cressets flaming in every street.
Through the cracks in the shutters of the sleeping-room
of Anatolius came in the glow of bonfires and the
stink of pitch and tallow. Songs of drunken legionaries
were bellowed from neighbouring taverns, amidst the
shrill laughter of prostitutes. Dominating all, rose the
praises of Jovian, and curses on Julian the renegade.
</p><p>
Anatolius, with a bitter smile, raised his arms skyward,
crying&mdash;
</p><p>
"In truth, thou hast conquered, Galilean!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="p2">XXI</h2>

<p>It was on board a great merchant galley with three
banks of oars, laden with soft Asian carpets and
amphoræ of olive-oil, on the voyage between Seleucia,
the port of Antioch, and Italy.
</p><p>
Sailing and rowing amongst the islands of the Archipelago,
the vessel was now making for Crete, where
she was to take on board a cargo of wool, and disembark
some ecclesiastics, bound for a Cretan monastery.
Old men, seated on the fore-deck, were passing the days
in pious gossip, prayer, or in their monkish avocation
of weaving baskets from slips of palm-leaf. In the
stern, under a light violet awning, other passengers
were installed, with whom the monks, considering
them Pagans, were anxious to have nothing to do.
These were Anatolius, Ammianus Marcellinus, and
Arsinoë.
</p><p>
The evening was calm. The rowers&mdash;slaves from
Alexandria&mdash;heaved and lowered their long oars to the
beat of an ancient chant. The sun was sinking amid
ruddy clouds. Anatolius was gazing at the waves,
thinking over the poet's phrase, <i>the many-laughtered
sea</i>.
</p><p>
After the hustling, the heat and dust of the streets
of Antioch, after the smoke of torches, and the fiery
breath of the rabble, he was lulling his mind with the
thought: "Thou of the many laughters, take me and
cleanse my soul!"
</p><p>
Isles of Calypso, Amorgos, Astypalæa, Thera,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
arose like visions, now lifting themselves from the sea,
now melting away, as if, all round the vessel, the
Oceanides were still leading their eternal dance. In
those waters Anatolius felt himself far back in the
days of the Odyssey.
</p><p>
His companions did not disturb his meditations, for
each was absorbed in work. Ammianus Marcellinus
was putting in order his memoirs of the Persian campaign
and the life of the Emperor Julian; and in the
evenings he used to read the remarkable work of the
Christian master, Clement of Alexandria, entitled,
<i>Stromata: The Patchwork Quilt</i>.
</p><p>
Arsinoë was making models in wax for a large
marble statue. It was the figure of some Olympian
deity, the face of which wore an expression of super human
sadness. Anatolius wished, but hesitated, to
ask her whether it represented Dionysus or Christ.
</p><p>
The artist had long ago abandoned the robes of a
nun. Pious folk had turned from her with horror,
and called her the recreant; but her name, and the
recollection of generous gifts formerly made to Christian
monasteries, safeguarded her from persecution.
Of her great fortune but a small portion remained, just
enough to secure independence; and on the shores of
the Gulf of Naples, not far from Baiæ, she still owned
a small estate, and the same villa in which Myrrha had
passed her last days. Thither Arsinoë, Anatolius, and
Marcellinus had agreed to retire after the stormy
troubles of recent years, to pass their lives in peace as
servants of the Muses.
</p><p>
The former nun now wore the same robes as before
her consecration. The noble and simple lines of the
peplum restored her resemblance to some ancient
Athenian vestal. But the stuff was sober in colour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
and her splendid hair thickly veiled. A wisdom almost
austere lay in those deep unsmiling eyes. Only
the white arms of the artist, bare to the shoulder,
relieved the sombre hues of her robe. She toiled
impatiently, almost feverishly, moulding the soft wax;
and her pale hands impressed Anatolius with a sense
of extraordinary power.
</p><p>
That evening the galley was coasting an islet of
which none knew the name. Far off, it looked like
an arid rock. In order to avoid dangerous reefs the
trireme had to pass close in to shore. Under the steep
cliff the sea-water lay so clear that sand and weed at
the bottom could be clearly distinguished. Beyond
the grim rocks could be seen green pastures, and sheep
feeding round a plane-tree.
</p><p>
Anatolius saw, seated at the foot of the tree, a lad
and a young girl, probably children of poor shepherds.
Behind them, among cypresses, was a small rough figure
of Pan playing the flute. Anatolius turned towards
Arsinoë to point out this remote and peaceful nook of
a lost Hellas; but the words died on his lips. Wholly
rapt, and with a look of strange gaiety, the artist
was intent on her creation, the waxen statuette, with its
face of haunting sadness, and proud Olympian attitude.
</p><p>
Anatolius felt her mood like a rebuff. He asked
Arsinoë in a harsh unsteady voice, pointing at the
model&mdash;
</p><p>
"Why are you making that? What does the thing
stand for?"
</p><p>
Slowly and with effort, she raised her eyes to his;
and he mused&mdash;
</p><p>
"The sibyls must have eyes like those!" and then
aloud: "Arsinoë, do you think that this work of
yours will be understood?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
</p><p>
"What matters it, friend?" she answered, smiling
gravely. Then she added in a lower tone, as if communing
with herself: "He will stretch out His hands
toward the world. He must be inexorable and terrible
as Mithra-Dionysus in all his strength and beauty; yet
merciful and humble...."
</p><p>
"What do you mean? is not that an impossible contradiction?"
</p><p>
"Who knows? For us, yes; but for the future...."
</p><p>
The sun was descending lower. Above him, on the
horizon westward, a storm-cloud was impending, and
the last rays illumined the island with a soft, almost
melancholy, glow.
</p><p>
The shepherd lad and his companion approached
Pan's altar to make their evening sacrifice.
</p><p>
"Is it your belief, Arsinoë," continued Anatolius,
"is it your faith that unknown brothers of ours shall
pick up the threads of our existence, and, following
the clue, go immeasurably farther than we? Do you
believe that all shall not perish in the barbaric gloom
which is sinking on Rome and Hellas? Ah, if that
were so? If one could trust the future...."
</p><p>
"Yes!" exclaimed Arsinoë, a prophetic gleam in
her sombre eyes, "the future is in us, in our madness
and our anguish! Julian was right. Content without
glory, in silence, strangers to all, and solitary among
men, we must work out our work to the end. We
must hide and cherish the last, the utmost spark
amongst the ashes of the altar, that tribes and nations
of the future may kindle from it new torches! Where
we finish they shall begin. Let Hellas die! Men
shall dig up her relics&mdash;unearth her divine fragments
of marble, yea, over them shall weep and pray! From
our tombs shall the yellowed leaves of the books we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
love be unsealed, and the ancient stories of Homer, the
wisdom of Plato, shall be spelt out slowly anew, as by
little children. And with Hellas, you and I shall live
again!"
</p><p>
"And with us, revives the curse on us!" exclaimed
Anatolius, "The struggle between Olympus and
Golgotha will begin over again!&mdash;Why? And when
shall that struggle end? Answer, sibyl, if thou
canst!"
</p><p>
Arsinoë was silent, and her eyes fell. Then she
glanced at Ammianus and pointed to him&mdash;
</p><p>
"There is one who will answer you better than I.
Like ours, his heart is shared between Christ and
Olympus, and yet he keeps the lucidity of his soul."
</p><p>
Ammianus Marcellinus, putting aside the manuscript
by Clement, had been quietly listening to the
discussion.
</p><p>
"In truth," said the Epicurean, addressing him,
"we have now been friends for more than four months,
and yet I do not know whether you are a Christian or
a Hellenist?"
</p><p>
"Nor I myself," answered the young Ammianus
frankly, with a blush.
</p><p>
"What? No torture of doubts? No suffering from
the antagonism between the Greek and the Christian
doctrine?"
</p><p>
"No, my friend; I think that the two teachings in
many points agree...."
</p><p>
"But how&mdash;from what point of view&mdash;do you intend
to write your account of the Roman Empire? One of
the two scales of the balance must sink and the other
rise?"
</p><p>
"Not consciously, I hope," answered the historian;
"My aim is to be just to both. Julian the Emperor I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
love, but even for him I shall be impartial. No one
shall know which side I join, any better than I know
myself...."
</p><p>
Anatolius had already proved the bravery, the
chivalrous friendship of Ammianus, and now he was
daily discovering in him other qualities no less rare.
</p><p>
"You are born to be a historian, Ammianus, to be
the judge of our passionate age, and to bring its warring
philosophies, in some sort, to a reconciliation!"
</p><p>
"I shall not be the first to do that," answered Ammianus.
He rose to his feet and pointing with enthusiasm
to the parchment-rolls of the great Christian
master&mdash;
</p><p>
"All you suggest is already written here; and with
far ampler powers than mine. This is the <i>Patchwork</i>
of Clement of Alexandria, in which he proves
that the greatness of Rome and the philosophy of
Hellas paved the way for the teaching of Christ, and,
by maxims and numberless forecasts, made the first
decided steps toward the earthly kingdom of God.
Plato is the forerunner of Jesus the Nazarene."
</p><p>
The last words, spoken with perfect simplicity, profoundly
impressed Anatolius. He seemed to remember
the whole scene as from some previous existence: the
island flushed by that setting sun; the smell of tar on
board the galley; and the words of Ammianus. The
vista of a new world was momentarily opened to his
mind.
</p><p>
Meanwhile the trireme was heading round the cape;
the little wood of cypress had almost disappeared behind
the cliffs. Anatolius threw a last look at the
lad and girl before the altar of Pan. The girl was
pouring out the evening offering of goat's milk and
honey; the boy beginning to play on his reed-pipe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
The thin blue smoke of sacrifice could be seen rising
above the wood after the human figures had vanished
and while the trireme made for open sea.
</p><p>
From the fore-part of the ship there came upon the
silence a solemn music; the old monks were chanting
in unison their evening prayer....
</p><p>
But over the still water came faint and clear notes of
another melody. It was the little shepherd, piping his
nocturnal hymn to Pan, the old god of gaiety, of freedom
and love.
</p><p>
Anatolius felt a thrill of wonder and surmise.
</p><p>
"<i>Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven</i>," the
monks chanted.
</p><p>
The silvery notes of the shepherd's flute, floating
high in the sky, mingled with the words of the
Christians.
</p><p>
The last beams faded from that happy islet, leaving
it dull and hueless in the midst of the sea. Both
hymns ceased.
</p><p>
The wind blew sharply in the rigging and whipped
up grey and white waves. The straining galley-timbers
creaked and groaned. Shadows approached
from the southward and the sea grew swiftly dark.
Huge clouds massed overhead, and from beyond the
horizon came the first long intermittent roll of thunder.
</p><p>
Night and Tempest, hand in hand, were striding on
apace.</p>
